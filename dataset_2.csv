"And then they kissed each other, and the girl wept, and gave him a rose; but before she did so, she pressed a kiss upon it so fervently that the flower opened.",6
"Oh, what bitter tears she shed! and she could not open her heart to any one for relief.",6
"Oh, how she wept and prayed that she also might die!",6
"Every morning he flew to the window of the poor girl, and always found her weeping by the flower pot.",6
"The bitter tears fell upon the jasmine twig, and each day, as she became paler and paler, the sprig appeared to grow greener and fresher.",6
"""Heaven preserve us!"" he thought, and opened his eyes wide, ""I cannot see anything at all,"" but he did not say so.",7
"""We are pleased to hear that,"" said the two weavers, and described to him the colours and explained the curious pattern.",4
"""Good heavens! listen to the voice of an innocent child,"" said the father, and one whispered to the other what the child had said.",7
"FAR down in the forest, where the warm sun and the fresh air made a sweet resting-place, grew a pretty little fir-tree; and yet it was not happy, it wished so much to be tall like its companions- the pines and firs which grew around it.",6
"As the axe cut through the stem, and divided the pith, the tree fell with a groan to the earth, conscious of pain and faintness, and forgetting all its anticipations of happiness, in sorrow at leaving its home in the forest.",6
How the fir-tree trembled!,3
"It trembled so with joy in all its branches, that one of the candles fell among the green leaves and burnt some of them.",4
"""Help! help!"" exclaimed the young ladies, but there was no danger, for they quickly extinguished the fire.",7
"For a moment the little ones stood silent with astonishment, and then they shouted for joy, till the room rang, and they danced merrily round the tree, while one present after another was taken from it.",4
"And then the tree related the whole story; he could remember every single word, and the little mice was so delighted with it, that they were ready to jump to the top of the tree.",4
"""Now life is beginning again,"" said the tree, rejoicing in the sunshine and fresh air.",4
"The pieces were placed in a fire under the copper, and they quickly blazed up brightly, while the tree sighed so deeply that each sigh was like a pistol-shot.",6
"How fortunate I am; it makes me so happy, it is such a pleasant thing to know that something can be made of me.",4
"How the sunshine cheers me, and how sweet and refreshing is the rain; my happiness overpowers me, no one in the world can feel happier than I am.""",4
"I am the happiest of all creatures.""",4
"Well, one day some people came, who took hold of the flax, and pulled it up by the roots; this was painful; then it was laid in water as if they intended to drown it; and, after that, placed near a fire as if it were to be roasted; all this was very shocking.",7
"""Well, this is quite wonderful; I could not have believed that I should be so favored by fortune.",4
"How wonderful it is, that after all I have suffered, I am made something of at last; I am the luckiest person in the world- so strong and fine; and how white, and what a length!",4
"I cannot be happier than I am now.""",4
This was my destiny; it is quite a blessing.,4
"Now I shall be of some use in the world, as everyone ought to be; it is the only way to be happy.",4
"I am happier than ever.""",4
"""Ugh,"" cried the paper, as it burst into a bright flame; ""ugh.""",7
"Whenever the sun shone, we felt his warm rays, and the little birds would relate stories to us as they sung.",4
"""'That is quite true,' said the water-bucket; and he made a spring with joy, and splashed some water on the floor.",4
"""The plates rattled with pleasure, and the carpet-broom brought some green parsley out of the dust-hole and crowned the saucepan, for he knew it would vex the others; and he thought, 'If I crown him to-day he will crown me to-morrow.'",4
"The street boys stood on tiptoe and shouted ""hurrah,"" and whistled between their fingers; altogether it was a very splendid affair.",4
"Then I would clench my fist, and cry, ""We will kill these Turks!""",2
"I saw my poor dead father, and cried till I fell asleep.",6
"""Sorry!"" he exclaimed, and his voice was troubled with a grief as deep as my own.",6
But the goblin felt very angry that any man should venture to say such things to a huckster who was a householder and sold the best butter.,2
"""My golden treasure, my riches, my sunshine!"" said the mother; and she kissed the shining locks, and it sounded like music and song in the room of the drummer; and there was joy, and life, and movement.",4
"She folded her hands, and hid her face in the cotton curtains of the bed, and wept.",6
They laughed and they wept; and Peter embraced the old Fire-drum.,4
"""Good Heaven! what's the matter with you?"" asked his mother.",7
"""Nothing, nothing; only leave me to myself,"" he answered but the tears were running down his cheeks.",6
"""My sweet child, my golden treasure!"" cried the mother, and she wept; but the Fire-drum sang, not out loud, but inwardly.",6
"His eyes were as clear and his face was as radiant as sunshine; and he held his mother in his arms, and she kissed his mouth, and wept as blissfully as any one can weep for joy; and he nodded at every old piece of furniture in the room, at the cupboard with the tea-cups, and at the flower-vase.",4
The counsellor stared with astonishment as he beheld a most strange procession pass before him.,7
"""Good gracious!"" he exclaimed; ""what in the world has happened to the bishop? what can he be thinking about?""",7
"""I don't understand your outlandish talk,"" he cried at last, angrily turning his back upon them.",2
"""Goodness me! where am I?"" said he.",7
It bewildered him as he thought of it.,7
"""Yes, this is East Street; how beautifully bright and gay it looks!",4
"It is quite shocking that one glass of punch should have upset me like this.""",7
"The lieutenant felt this very keenly, and therefore leaned his head against the window-frame, and sighed deeply.",6
"""There goes one!"" cried he.",7
"He declared, when he quite recovered himself, that this had been the most dreadful night he had ever passed; not for a hundred pounds would he go through such feelings again.",3
"He started back, quite bewildered with the fright which the goloshes of Fortune had caused him.",7
"""Good gracious!"" he sighed, ""I must have a tendency to softening of the brain, and here it is so exceedingly hot that the blood is rushing to my head.""",7
"It is overpowering, and yet it is delightful.""",4
"As the clerk thought of all these things, and became conscious of the great change in his own feelings, he smiled, and said to himself, ""I must be asleep and dreaming; and yet, if so, how wonderful for a dream to be so natural and real, and to know at the same time too that it is but a dream.",4
"The canary-bird fluttered in his cage, and the parrot flapped his wings and cried, ""Let us be men;"" the poor clerk, in the most deadly terror, flew through the window, over the houses, and through the streets, till at length he was obliged to seek a resting-place.",3
"""Heaven preserve us!"" said he; ""How did I get up here and fall asleep in this way?",7
"""Dead!"" cried the laundress, turning pale as death.",7
"""Is he dead?"" she exclaimed.",7
"Oh, my poor child,"" and she burst into tears.",6
"And he, poor boy, wept also, as he sat alone by the river, near to and watching the damp linen.",6
"I kissed her hand, and wept bitter tears, and I wept still more when I went to my room, and threw myself on the bed.",6
"""Oh, my poor mother!"" he cried, while the tears rolled down his cheeks.",6
"She has a hymn-book with large silver clasps, in which she often reads; and in the book, between the leaves, lies a rose, quite flat and dry; it is not so pretty as the roses which are standing in the glass, and yet she smiles at it most pleasantly, and tears even come into her eyes.",4
"At her side sits a young man, tall and strong; he gives her a rose and she smiles.",4
"She smiled once more, and then people said she was dead.",4
"Her Puggie had seated itself on the ground while she wrote, and growled; for the dog had come with her for amusement and for the sake of its health; and then the bare floor ought not to be offered to a visitor.",2
"She had not a button- that she knew right well, and therefore she remained standing sorrowfully outside, till all the others had seen the grave and had gone away; then she sat down, held her little brown hands before her eyes, and burst into tears; this girl alone had not seen Puggie's grave.",6
It was a grief as great to her as any grown person can experience.,6
"They lived quite retired and very happily; and as they had no children of their own, they had adopted a little common snail, which they brought up as their own child.",4
"I am very glad we have such good houses, and that the little one has one of his own.",4
"""There can be nothing better than we have here,"" said the father-snail; ""I wish for nothing more.""",4
"You need not be in a hurry; you are always so impatient, and the youngster is getting just the same.",2
He will be the joy of our home; and we old folks have nothing else to live for.,4
"""There may be black snails, no doubt,"" said the old snail; ""black snails without houses; but they are so vulgar and conceited too.",2
"And the rain fell upon the burdock-leaves, to play the drum for them, and the sun shone to paint colors on the burdock forest for them, and they were very happy; the whole family were entirely and perfectly happy.",4
"""It must be a kind of garden plant,"" said another; and so they sneered and despised the plant as a thing from a garden.",2
"""It is stupid nonsense to allow yourself to shoot out in this way; we are not here to support you.""",2
"With pious gratitude the girl looked upon this glorious work of God, and bent down over one of the branches, that she might examine the flower and inhale the sweet perfume.",4
"Then a light broke in on her mind, and her heart expanded.",4
"The poor swineherd took these words to heart, for they were addressed to him; he knew not that there were others who were equally ignorant.",6
"Then the king, in his melancholy, wandered out to the spot in the wood.",6
"And the old grandfather nodded again; and the more he looked at Holger Danske, the more satisfied he felt that he had carved a good image of him.",4
"The old grandfather wiped his eyes, for he had known King Frederick, with his silvery locks and his honest blue eyes, and had lived for him, and he folded his hands and remained for some time silent.",6
"They ran on a little farther, and then Christina fell down, and began to cry.",6
"Presently the scream of an eagle sounded through the wood; it was an ugly cry, and it frightened the children; but before them, in the thickest part of the forest, grew the most beautiful blackberries, in wonderful quantities.",3
"So they went on, but the road led them out of the way; no house could be seen, it grew dark, and the children were afraid.",3
"At last they both lost themselves in the thicket; Christina began to cry, and then Ib cried too; and, after weeping and lamenting for some time, they stretched themselves down on the dry leaves and fell asleep.",6
"Great quantities of fish could be seen through the clear water, sparkling in the sun's rays; they were quite surprised when they came so suddenly upon such an unexpected sight.",7
"He could not utter a word; he could only seize her hand and hold it fast in his own, but he felt too happy and glad to open his lips.",4
"His eyes brightened, and the words he uttered came with hesitation from his lips, but from the deepest recesses of his heart: ""Christina, if you have not become too grand, and if you can be contented to live in my mother's house as my wife, we will be married some day.",4
"I can trust you, for I believe that I do love you.",4
"At first Ib said not a word, but he became as white as the wall, and shook his head gently, and then he spoke,- ""Christina must not refuse this good fortune.""",6
"Very little was said about the matter to Ib, and he did not refer to it; his mother, however, noticed that he had grown very silent and pensive.",6
"At last a very little girl came out of one of the wretched-looking houses, and Ib asked her to tell him the way to the street he wanted; she looked up timidly at him, and began to cry bitterly.",6
"Her youngest child, looked for in the midst of prosperity, had sunk into the grave when only a few weeks old; and at last Christina herself became sick unto death, and lay, forsaken and dying, in a miserable room, amid poverty she might have borne in her younger days, but which was now more painful to her from the luxuries to which she had lately been accustomed.",6
"It makes me unhappy to think that I shall die, and leave this poor child,"" sighed she.",6
"The Grasshopper only sprang half as high, but he sprang straight into the King's face, and the King declared that was horribly rude.",2
"And then he sang his own melancholy song, and from that we have gathered this story, which they say is not true, though it's in print.",6
"""Everything around me is so wonderfully bright and warm, and beautiful, that it makes me joyous.""",4
"You may have thousands of my days, but I have thousands of moments in which I can be merry and happy.",4
"And the little creature danced and floated in the air, rejoicing in her delicate wings of gauze and velvet, rejoicing in the balmy breezes, laden with the fragrance of clover-fields and wild roses, elder-blossoms and honeysuckle, from the garden hedges, wild thyme, primroses, and mint, and the scent of all these was so strong that the perfume almost intoxicated the little fly.",4
"The long and beautiful day had been so full of joy and sweet delights, that when the sun sank low it felt tired of all its happiness and enjoyment.",4
The same thing was continued through many generations of Ephemera; all of them felt equally merry and equally happy.,4
"Once, but long years had intervened since then, guitars and Eolian harps had been hung on his boughs by merry travellers; now they seemed to hang there again, and he could hear their marvellous tones.",4
"Then it seemed as if new life was thrilling through every fibre of root and stem and leaf, rising even to the highest branches.",4
"As he grew higher and still higher, with increased strength, his topmost boughs became broader and fuller; and in proportion to his growth, so was his self-satisfaction increased, and with it arose a joyous longing to grow higher and higher, to reach even to the warm, bright sun itself.",4
"The grand, majestic oak could not be quite happy in the midst of his enjoyment, while all the rest, both great and small, were not with him.",6
At length his longing was satisfied.,4
"May beetles hummed, the bees murmured, the birds sang, each in his own way; the air was filled with the sounds of song and gladness.""",4
"""Why this is beautiful, too beautiful to be believed,"" said the oak in a joyful tone.",4
"Can such happiness be imagined?""",4
"Thus sounded the old Christmas carol, and every one on board the ship felt his thoughts elevated, through the song and the prayer, even as the old tree had felt lifted up in its last, its beautiful dream on that Christmas morn.",4
"Tears of sorrow rolled down their cheeks, and fell in heavy drops on the floor, but not a word was spoken.",6
"With silent steps, still sobbing, they left the room.",6
"They looked at Little Claus ploughing with his five horses, and he was so proud that he smacked his whip, and said, ""Gee-up, my five horses.""",4
"""I promise you I will not say it any more,"" said the other; but as soon as people came by, nodding to him, and wishing him ""Good day,"" he became so pleased, and thought how grand it looked to have five horses ploughing in his field, that he cried out again, ""Gee-up, all my horses!""",4
"""Oh, now I have no horse at all, said Little Claus, weeping.",6
"When she heard the farmer coming she was frightened, and begged the sexton to hide himself in a large empty chest that stood in the room.",3
"So the woman was obliged to bring out the wine also, which she had hidden, and the farmer drank it till he became quite merry.",4
"""I should like to see him now, while I am so merry.""",4
"""Will you come and help me hold it?"" said the farmer, going towards the chest in which his wife had hidden the sexton, who now lay inside, very much frightened.",3
"""Skins, skins!"" they cried, mocking him; ""yes, we'll mark your skin for you, till it is black and blue.""",2
"She had been cross, unkind, and really spiteful to him; but he was very sorry, and took the dead woman and laid her in his warm bed to see if he could bring her to life again.",6
"Again and again he bawled it out, but as she did not stir he flew into a passion, and threw the glass of mead in her face; it struck her on the nose, and she fell backwards out of the cart, for she was only seated there, not tied in.",2
"Great Claus got so frightened that he rushed out of the surgery, jumped into the cart, whipped up his horses, and drove home quickly.",3
"""And I, poor fellow,"" said the drover, ""I who am so old already, cannot get there.""",6
"""Yes, if I only knew a fresh one,"" said the old man, and nodded smilingly.",4
"He was an old, old sailor, and she his old wife; they had already great-grandchildren, and were soon to celebrate their golden wedding, but they could not remember the date, and the elder-tree mother was sitting in the tree and looked as pleased as this one here.",4
"I tore it open and read it; I cried and laughed at the same time, and was so happy!",4
"The elder-tree smelt strongly, and the setting sun illuminated the faces of the two old people, so that they looked quite rosy; the youngest of the grandchildren danced round them, and cried merrily that there would be a feast in the evening, for they were to have hot potatoes; and the elder mother nodded in the tree and cried 'Hooray' with the others.""",4
"She and the boy kissed each other, and then they were of the same age and felt the same joys.",4
"""You must know that as soon as the king and all the court are gone into the town, the flowers run out of the garden into the castle, and you should see how merry they are.",4
"It was saying, 'You are so pretty, I like you very much.'",4
"""Oh how funny!"" said Ida, and she laughed.",4
"He did not like the student, and would grumble when he saw him cutting out droll or amusing pictures.",2
"But the lawyer did not like such jokes, and he would say as he had just said, ""How can anyone put such nonsense into a child's head! what absurd fancies there are!""",2
"So she took the doll out, who looked quite cross, and said not a single word, for she was angry at being turned out of her bed.",2
"They did not look ill at all now, but jumped about and were very merry, yet none of them noticed little Ida.",4
"All at once the wax doll which rode on the carnival rod seemed to grow larger and taller, and it turned round and said to the paper flowers, ""How can you put such things in a child's head? they are all foolish fancies;"" and then the doll was exactly like the lawyer with the broad brimmed hat, and looked as yellow and as cross as he did; but the paper dolls struck him on his thin legs, and he shrunk up again and became quite a little wax doll.",2
"This was very amusing, and Ida could not help laughing.",4
"Then Sophy raised himself, and looked round quite astonished, ""There must be a ball here to-night,"" said Sophy.",7
"Then Sophy was very happy, and said they might keep her bed; she did not mind lying in the drawer at all.",4
"""You are not kind at all,"" said Ida; ""and yet they all danced with you.""",2
"Shivering with cold and hunger, she crept along; poor little child, she looked the picture of misery.",6
"She took the little girl in her arms, and they both flew upwards in brightness and joy far above the earth, where there was neither cold nor hunger nor pain, for they were with God.",4
"Here she slept at night, but during the day she amused herself on a table, where the woman had placed a plateful of water.",4
"The tiny little creature woke very early in the morning, and began to cry bitterly when she found where she was, for she could see nothing but water on every side of the large green leaf, and no way of reaching the land.",6
"""Croak, croak, croak,"" was all her son could say for himself; so the toad took up the elegant little bed, and swam away with it, leaving Tiny all alone on the green leaf, where she sat and wept.",6
"She could not bear to think of living with the old toad, and having her ugly son for a husband.",6
"As soon as they caught sight of her, they saw she was very pretty, and it made them very sorry to think that she must go and live with the ugly toads.",6
"Tiny pleased him, and she was glad of it, for now the toad could not possibly reach her, and the country through which she sailed was beautiful, and the sun shone upon the water, till it glittered like liquid gold.",4
"Oh, how frightened little Tiny felt when the cockchafer flew with her to the tree!",3
"Then he flew down with her from the tree, and placed her on a daisy, and she wept at the thought that she was so ugly that even the cockchafers would have nothing to say to her.",6
"She felt dreadfully cold, for her clothes were torn, and she was herself so frail and delicate, that poor little Tiny was nearly frozen to death.",6
"She was very pleased with Tiny, so she said, ""You are quite welcome to stay with me all the winter, if you like; but you must keep my rooms clean and neat, and tell me stories, for I shall like to hear them very much.""",4
"And Tiny did all the field-mouse asked her, and found herself very comfortable.",4
"It made little Tiny very sad to see it, she did so love the little birds; all the summer they had sung and twittered for her so beautifully.",6
"Then she laid her head on the bird's breast, but she was alarmed immediately, for it seemed as if something inside the bird went ""thump, thump.""",7
"Tiny trembled very much; she was quite frightened, for the bird was large, a great deal larger than herself,- she was only an inch high.",3
"The whole winter the swallow remained underground, and Tiny nursed him with care and love.",4
"Tiny looked after him, and the tears rose in her eyes.",6
"""Tweet, tweet,"" sang the bird, as he flew out into the green woods, and Tiny felt very sad.",6
But Tiny was not at all pleased; for she did not like the tiresome mole.,6
"Then Tiny wept, and said she would not marry the disagreeable mole.",6
"The poor child was very unhappy at the thought of saying farewell to the beautiful sun, and as the field-mouse had given her permission to stand at the door, she went to look at it once more.",6
"As soon as he spied Tiny, he was delighted; and then she told him how unwilling she felt to marry the ugly mole, and to live always beneath the earth, and never to see the bright sun any more.",4
And as she told him she wept.,6
"""That will be delightful,"" she said, and clapped her little hands for joy.",4
"The little prince was at first quite frightened at the bird, who was like a giant, compared to such a delicate little creature as himself; but when he saw Tiny, he was delighted, and thought her the prettiest little maiden he had ever seen.",4
"But I am fragrant with perfume, for close to my gates most lovely roses bloom.""",4
"The old washerwoman put her head in at the door, and nodded to him quite kindly, and said, ""Many thanks, you good child, for your help yesterday.",4
"""I know where it blooms,"" said a happy mother, who came with her lovely child to the bedside of the queen.",4
"She wept over it, kissed it, and prayed for it as only a mother can pray in that hour of her anguish.""",6
"Tears stood in his eyes, and glistened on his cheeks; he carried a great book and the binding was of velvet, with silver clasps.",6
He seemed a merry fellow.,4
"He looked very jovial, did little work, and had the more holidays.",4
"How pretty she was! and such a singer! not a theatre singer, nor a ballad singer; no, but a singer of the woods; for she wandered through the gay green forest, and had a concert there for her own amusement.",4
"He was hungry and thirsty, yet no one gave him anything; and when it became dark, and they were about to close the gardens, the porter turned him out.",6
The little boy said not a word; he was half pleased and half afraid.,4
"One glory eclipsed another; yet there was one picture that fixed itself on the little boy's memory, more especially because of the happy children it represented, for these the little boy had seen in daylight.",4
"The boy raised his hands towards the smiling children, and then the Pig ran off with him through the open vestibule.",4
"Fear and trembling came upon him as he thought of his mother; she had sent him out the day before to get some money, he had not done so, and now he was hungry and thirsty.",3
"Here everything was bright, and the boy knelt down by the first tomb on his right, the grave of Michael Angelo, and sobbed as if his heart would break.",6
"Hunger and thirst overpowered the child, and he became quite faint and ill.",6
"A little homely bed was prepared for him, but to him who had so often slept on the hard stones it was a royal couch, and he slept sweetly and dreamed of the splendid pictures and of the Metal Pig.",4
"He wept at the thought, and then he played with the little, lively dog, and kissed it, while the old woman looked kindly at him to encourage him.",6
"So the boy stayed with them, and the woman herself taught him to sew; and he ate well, and slept well, and became very merry.",4
"They stopped before the picture by Bronzino, in which Christ is represented as standing in the lower world, with the children smiling before Him, in the sweet expectation of entering heaven; and the poor boy smiled, too, for here was his heaven.",4
A fiery dragon could not have frightened the little boy so much as did the little dog in this place.,3
"Giuseppe went off at once, while his wife lamented, and the boy wept.",6
"Then there was great rejoicing, and the painter caressed the boy, and gave him a number of pictures.",4
"Certainly it was rather crooked, rather up and down, one leg thick, and another thin; still it was like the copy, and he was overjoyed at what he had done.",4
"He knew very well that he had enough inside him to buy up all the other toys, and this gave him a very good opinion of his own value.",4
"The doll, whose neck had been darned, was so excited that the place in her neck burst, and the money-pig declared he must do something for one of the players, as they had all pleased him so much.",4
"The sun shone among the delicate leaves; everything breathed forth the loveliest fragrance, and all felt as we do when we are filled with joy at the thought of our happiness.",4
"I am heartily tired of such neighbours.""",2
"""We make it lively about the house,"" said the sparrow-mother; ""and people say that a swallows' nest brings luck; so they are glad of us.",4
"But they were very pleased with it, and wondered whether all the little sparrows could become nightingales.",4
The horse-hair was drawn tightly round her leg- as tightly as if the latter were to be cut off; she was in great pain and terror.,3
"He was a merry old man, always wandering about.",4
At these words an icy shudder ran through the sparrow-mother.,3
"But she, trembling in every limb, did not think of the adornment.",3
"""Now you will see the gold-jacket fly,"" said the old man, letting the sparrow go, which flew away in deadly fear, with the sun shining upon her.",3
"All the sparrows, and even a crow- and an old boy he was too- were startled at the sight; but still they flew after her to learn what kind of strange bird she was.",7
"Driven by fear and horror, she flew homeward; she was almost sinking fainting to the earth, while the flock of pursuing birds increased, some even attempting to peck at her.",3
"Then they all got excited; they hit out with their wings, pecked with their beaks, and flop! one after another was thrown out of the nest.",2
"There they lay with their anger, holding their heads on one side and blinking the eye that was turned upwards.",2
And the eyes of all sparkled with malice.,2
The roses nodded; they recognized their grey neighbours and were pleased to see them again.,4
"The books travelled all over the world, and some of them came into the hands of the emperor; and he sat in his golden chair, and, as he read, he nodded his approval every moment, for it pleased him to find such a beautiful description of his city, his palace, and his gardens.",4
"Then the tears come into my eyes, and it is just as if my mother kissed me.""",4
"""With the greatest pleasure,"" said the nightingale, and began to sing most delightfully.",4
"The nightingale sang so sweetly that the tears came into the emperor's eyes, and then rolled down his cheeks, as her song became still more touching and went to every one's heart.",4
"The emperor was so delighted that he declared the nightingale should have his gold slipper to wear round her neck, but she declined the honor with thanks: she had been sufficiently rewarded already.",4
"So a year passed, and the emperor, the court, and all the other Chinese knew every little turn in the artificial bird's song; and for that same reason it pleased them better.",4
"Now there was great sorrow, as the bird could only be allowed to play once a year; and even that was dangerous for the works inside it.",6
"Cold and pale lay the emperor in his royal bed; the whole court thought he was dead, and every one ran away to pay homage to his successor.",6
These are the jewels that rejoice a singer's heart.,4
"I will sit on a bough outside your window, in the evening, and sing to you, so that you may be happy, and have thoughts full of joy.",4
"The servants now came in to look after the dead emperor; when, lo! there he stood, and, to their astonishment, said, ""Good morning.""",7
"She said this merrily, for she was the best of the hens, and, moreover, as had been said, very respectable.",4
"If I were a cock, I should despise her.""",2
"The hen who had lost the loose little feather naturally did not recognise her own story, and being a respectable hen, said: ""I despise those fowls; but there are more of that kind.",2
He's angry to-day.,2
"""'Could I but have my love, Who then so happy as Glove!",4
"And so it was with Anthony; often the scalding tears, like pearly drops, would fall from his eyes to the coverlet and roll on the floor with a sound as if one of his heartstrings had broken.",6
"If he dried his eyes with his nightcap, then the tear and the picture would be crushed; but the source of the tears remained and welled up again in his heart.",6
"Then they got a flower-pot, filled it with earth, and were soon both very busy and eager about it.",4
"And Molly and Anthony both wept, but these tears all flowed together into one tear which had the rosy shimmer of joy.",6
One stanza pleased him exceedingly-,4
"Hot iron and cold iron alike take the skin from our lips, and we feel the same sensation if we kiss either; and Anthony's kiss was now the kiss of hatred, as it had once been the kiss of love.",2
"Sorrow and suffering deprived Anthony's father of his strength, so that he had something else to think of besides nursing his love-sorrows and his anger against Molly.",6
How much came back to his remembrance as he looked through the tears once more on his native town!,6
"There lay the old bachelor, forsaken by all, and unable to help himself.",6
"The fragrant leaves of the tree fell upon him and cooled his burning brow; upon his parched lips they seemed like refreshing bread and wine; and as they rested on his breast, a peaceful calm stole over him, and he felt inclined to sleep.",4
"In that solemn hour the sweet and joyous chiming filled the hearts of those in the humble dwelling with thankfulness and trust; and when, amidst these joyous sounds, a little son was born to them, the words of prayer and praise arose from their overflowing hearts, and their happiness seemed to ring out over town and country in the liquid tones of the church bells' chime.",4
"Its parents kissed it lovingly, and the father wrote these words in the Bible, ""On the tenth of November, 1759, God sent us a son.""",4
"He and his sister, two years older than himself, had often wept scalding tears over the story of Him who suffered death on the cross for us all.",6
"His mother also told him how the chiming of that old bell had once filled her heart with joy and confidence, and that in the midst of the sweet tones her child had been given to her.",4
"A record of this bright display will live in the memory of man, for through it the pupil in the military school was in tears and sorrow.",6
"Dark days and cold nights also passed over the old bell, and it noticed them not; but the bell in the man's heart felt it to be a gloomy time.",6
"The corpse lay in a bedroom, near to the one in which we sat, and the old man was in great distress and weeping like a child.",6
"He spoke to my father, and to a few neighbors who were there, of how lonely he should feel now she was gone, and how good and true she, his dead wife, had been during the number of years that they had passed through life together, and how they had become acquainted, and learnt to love each other.",6
"And then he talked of his wedding-day; and his eyes brightened, and he seemed to be carried back, by his words, to that joyful time.",4
"And the old attendant nodded and looked very pleased, and then he carried the tin soldier into the house.",4
"""Oh,"" replied the old man, ""I have pleasant thoughts of all that has passed, recalled by memory; and now you are come to visit me, and that is very pleasant.""",4
"""I cannot endure it,"" said the tin soldier, who stood on a shelf, ""it is so lonely and dull here.",6
"Then the old man came back with a pleasant face; and brought with him beautiful preserved fruits, as well as apples and nuts; and the little boy thought no more of the tin soldier.",4
"How happy and delighted the little boy was; and after he returned home, and while days and weeks passed, a great deal of nodding took place from one house to the other, and then the little boy went to pay another visit.",4
"""I cannot bear it any longer,"" said the tin soldier; ""I have wept tears of tin, it is so melancholy here.",6
"Then he looked at the picture he had bought at the broker's, and his eyes sparkled brightly as he nodded at it, and said, ""Ah, she could sing that tune.""",4
"The sparrows assembled in dozens upon the wild vines, and chattered all together as loud as they could, but not about the old house; none of them could remember it, for many years had passed by, so many indeed, that the little boy was now a man, and a really good man too, and his parents were very proud of him.",4
"""Let me see him,"" said the young man, and then he smiled and shook his head, and said, ""It can scarcely be the same, but it reminds me of something that happened to one of my tin soldiers when I was a little boy.""",4
"""Yes, terribly lonely,"" cried the tin soldier; ""still it is delightful not to be forgotten.""",4
"He bent his head mournfully, and sighed in deep sorrow, as an unquiet spirit might sigh.",6
"Song doth not carry them forth over the lands, nor into the hearts of men; therefore I have no rest and no peace.""",6
Then the face of the dead one gleamed like the margin of the cloud in the moonlight.,4
How sweetly they sing there; it is quite a pleasure to listen to them!,4
"""Well, then, why do you lie in my way?"" she retorted, ""you must not be so touchy.",2
"I have nerves of my own, but I do not cry 'tweet.'""",2
"When madam awoke afterwards, there he stood before her with a little corn he had found, and laid it at her feet; but as she had not slept well, she was naturally in a bad temper.",2
"Don't stand there, looking so stupid.""",2
"""Impertinent creature!"" exclaimed the Portuguese duck: ""would you compare me with the cat- that beast of prey?",2
"""You'll kill me with your crowing,"" she cried, ""it's all your fault.",2
"""We shall never have another singing-bird again amongst us; he was almost a Chinese,"" they whispered, and then they wept with such a noisy, clucking sound, that all the other fowls clucked too, but the ducks went about with redder eyes afterwards.",6
"""Justice must still be carried out, even when one has relations and good friends among the prize committee; but that the snail should have received the second prize, I consider almost an insult to myself"" ""No,"" said the fence-rail, who had been a witness at the distribution of prizes; ""there should be some consideration for industry and perseverance.",2
"But I do not understand chattering and boasting; on the contrary, I despise it.""",2
And the snail spat at them with contempt.,2
"She was frightened, and wanted to throw the red shoes away; but they stuck fast.",3
"""Mercy!"" cried Karen.",3
"And she went quickly up to the church-door; but when she came there, the red shoes were dancing before her, and she was frightened, and turned back.",3
"During the whole week she was sad and wept many bitter tears, but when Sunday came again she said: ""Now I have suffered and striven enough.",6
"Then she became terrified, and turned back and repented right heartily of her sin.",3
"On the following Sunday they all went to church, and she was asked whether she wished to go too; but, with tears in her eyes, she looked sadly at her crutches.",6
"Here she sat down with her hymn-book, and as she was reading it with a pious mind, the wind carried the notes of the organ over to her from the church, and in tears she lifted up her face and said: ""O God! help me!""",6
"""What! is he going to propose to me?"" said the scissors, and she became so angry that she cut too sharply into the shirt collar, and it was obliged to be thrown by as useless.",2
"""Summer cannot show a more beautiful sight,"" she exclaimed, while her eyes sparkled.",4
"The girl laughed, and nodded at the Snow Man, and then tripped away over the snow with her friend.",4
"""But we are very much frightened,"" said the young storks, and they drew back their heads into the nests.",3
"""Oh, o- h!"" cried the young storks.",7
"The young storks were very angry, and grew worse as they grew older; so at last their mother was obliged to promise that they should be revenged, but not until the day of their departure.",2
"The emperor ordered them to be carried into the great hall where the princess was just playing ""Visitors are coming"" with her ladies-in-waiting; when she saw the large cases with the presents therein, she clapped her hands for joy.",4
"""You are right,"" said the emperor, and began to cry like a little child.",6
"When the princess with her ladies passed by and heard the tune, she stopped and looked quite pleased, for she also could play it- in fact, it was the only tune she could play, and she played it with one finger.",4
That was a pleasure!,4
The ladies danced and clapped their hands for joy.,4
"""Go out of my sight,"" said the emperor, for he was very angry; and both the princess and the swineherd were banished from the empire.",2
"There she stood and cried, the swineherd scolded her, and the rain came down in torrents.",6
"Oh, how wretched I am!""",6
"""Ugh, you beast!"" said the farm laborer who emptied the bucket, when he saw the toad.",2
She was glad that in her ugliness she had frightened the fowls.,4
"Yes, I shall get to Egypt, for I feel so happy!",4
"Far in the interior of the wood, where a noisy swarm of laborers were working, stood Waldemar Daa and his three daughters, and all were laughing at the wild cries of the birds, excepting one, the youngest, Anna Dorothea, who felt grieved to the heart; and when they made preparations to fell a tree that was almost dead, and on whose naked branches the black stork had built her nest, she saw the poor little things stretching out their necks, and she begged for mercy for them, with the tears in her eyes.",6
"Ida and Anna Dorothea wept bitterly, Joanna stood, pale and proud, biting her lips till the blood came; but what could that avail?",6
I suppose he is under the ground now; and Ida- alas! alas! it is not ended yet; miserable that I am!,6
"However, he passed a very pleasant time; went to the theatre, drove in the king's garden, and gave a great deal of money to the poor, which was very good of him; he remembered what it had been in olden times to be without a shilling.",4
"Now he was rich, had fine clothes, and many friends, who all declared he was a fine fellow and a real gentleman, and all this gratified him exceedingly.",4
"""And here is one, and there is another!"" they all exclaimed; for there were crosses on all the doors in every direction.",7
"The shoemaker's boy liked the idea of getting the four shillings, so he ran very fast and fetched the tinder-box, and gave it to the soldier.",4
"The princess came out of the copper castle, and became queen, which was very pleasing to her.",4
"It touched the tin soldier so much to see her that he almost wept tin tears, but he kept them back.",4
"But the ball, which wore a dress of morocco leather, and thought as much of herself as any other young lady, would not even condescend to reply.",2
"""I know very well where she is,"" sighed the top; ""she is in the swallow's nest, and has married the swallow.""",6
"""Ah,"" she exclaimed, ""here is a gilt top.""",7
"The duck stared at it and exclaimed, ""It is very large and not at all like the others.",7
"""He is too big,"" they all said, and the turkey cock, who had been born into the world with spurs, and fancied himself really an emperor, puffed himself out like a vessel in full sail, and flew at the duckling, and became quite red in the head with passion, so that the poor little thing did not know where to go, and was quite miserable because he was so ugly and laughed at by the whole farmyard.",6
"Here he remained the whole night, feeling very tired and sorrowful.",6
How they terrified the poor duckling!,3
"She laid good eggs, and her mistress loved her as if she had been her own child.",4
"So the duckling sat in a corner, feeling very low spirited, till the sunshine and the fresh air came into the room through the open door, and then he began to feel such a great longing for a swim on the water, that he could not help telling the hen.",6
All this was very sad for the poor little duckling.,6
The duckling had never seen any like them before.,7
"Could he ever forget those beautiful, happy birds; and when at last they were out of his sight, he dived under the water, and rose again almost beside himself with excitement.",4
"The warmth revived the poor little creature; but when the children wanted to play with him, the duckling thought they would do him some harm; so he started up in terror, fluttered into the milk-pan, and splashed the milk about the room.",3
"Then the woman clapped her hands, which frightened him still more.",3
"The duckling remembered the lovely birds, and felt more strangely unhappy than ever.",6
"He now felt glad at having suffered sorrow and trouble, because it enabled him to enjoy so much better all the pleasure and happiness around him; for the great swans swam round the new-comer, and stroked his neck with their beaks, as a welcome.",4
"""See,"" cried the youngest, ""there is a new one;"" and the rest were delighted, and ran to their father and mother, dancing and clapping their hands, and shouting joyously, ""There is another swan come; a new one has arrived.""",4
"Then he rustled his feathers, curved his slender neck, and cried joyfully, from the depths of his heart, ""I never dreamed of such happiness as this, while I was an ugly duckling.""",4
"At last the prince had his own statue erected on the public places and fixed on the royal palaces; nay, he even wished it to be placed in the churches, on the altars, but in this the priests opposed him, saying: ""Prince, you are mighty indeed, but God's power is much greater than yours; we dare not obey your orders.""",2
"They buzzed round the prince and stung his face and hands; angrily he drew his sword and brandished it, but he only touched the air and did not hit the gnats.",2
"Mad with pain, he tore off the coverings and his clothes too, flinging them far away, and danced about before the eyes of his ferocious soldiers, who now mocked at him, the mad prince, who wished to make war with God, and was overcome by a single little gnat.",2
"He looked around on every side and exclaimed, ""Oh, heavens, where am ",7
"Then he got up and clambered out of the cave, went into the forest, and thought, ""Here I am quite alone and deserted, how shall I obtain a horse no",6

"Now when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Ashputtel went sorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out",6
"Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it; for they had beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the golden slipper",4
"Then the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw, by the blood that streamed from it, what a trick she had played him",7
"""No,"" said he; ""there is only a little dirty Ashputtel here, the child of my first wife; I am sure she cannot be the bride.",2
"And when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her, and said, ""This is the right bride.",4
"Now this king and queen had plenty of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of good things to eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day: but though they had been married many years they had no children, and this grieved them very much indeed",6
"Then the queen took pity on the little fish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away it lifted its head out of the water and said, ""I know what your wish is, and it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me--you will soon have a daughter.",4
"What the little fish had foretold soon came to pass; and the queen had a little girl, so very beautiful that the king could not cease looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great feast and make merry, and show the child to all the land",4
"Now, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and scolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her revenge",2
"So she cried out, ""The king""s daughter shall, in her fifteenth year, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.",2
"However, the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from the threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom should be bought up and burnt",3
"She looked so beautiful that he could not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss",4
"But the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled upon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also awoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder",4

"From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but when the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found outside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: ""Come, cat, we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves--we shall enjoy that.",4
"""Yes,"" answered the cat, ""you will enjoy it as much as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the window.",2
"""Alas!"" said the mouse, ""now I see what has happened, now it comes to light",7
You a true friend,7
"First top off, then half-done, then--"" ""Will you hold your tongue,"" cried the cat, ""one word more, and I will eat you too.",2
"But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she felt that her end drew near she called the king to her and said, ""Promise me that you will never marry again, unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful as I am, and who has golden hair like mine.",6
"Then when the king in his grief promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died",6
"But the king was not to be comforted, and for a long time never thought of taking another wife",6
"When the courtiers heard this they were shocked, and said, ""Heaven forbid that a father should marry his daughter",7
"And his daughter was also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts; so she said to him, ""Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses: one must be of gold, like the sun; another must be of shining silver, like the moon; and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this, I want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to which every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin.",7
"Then she threw herself upon Heaven for help in her need, and went away, and journeyed on the whole night, till at last she came to a large wood",3
"""Look sharp!"" said the king to the huntsmen, ""and see what sort of game lies there.",7
"And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and when they came back again said, ""In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful beast, such as we never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand kinds of fur, but there it lies fast asleep.",7
"So the huntsmen took it up, and the maiden awoke and was greatly frightened, and said, ""I am a poor child that has neither father nor mother left; have pity on me and take me with you.",3
Thus Cat-skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully,6
"But the king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and he thought in his heart, ""I never saw any one half so beautiful.",4
"When the dance was over, the king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well, that he thought he had never tasted any so good before",4
"The cook was frightened when he heard the order, and said to Cat-skin, ""You must have let a hair fall into the soup; if it be so, you will have a good beating.",3
"Then she ran to her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her dress out which was silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she went in, looking like a king""s daughter, the king went up to her, and rejoiced at seeing her again, and when the dance began he danced with her",4
"Whilst the cook was above stairs, she got the golden necklace and dropped it into the soup; then it was brought to the king, who ate it, and it pleased him as well as before; so he sent for the cook, who was again forced to tell him that Cat-skin had cooked it",4
"Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars, and went into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again, and thought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then",4
"But the king said, ""You are my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each other.",4
"And the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as ever was heard of or seen in that country, or indeed in any other",4
"Then said the maid: ""What a clever Elsie we have!"" and sat down beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune",6
"The boy went down, and there sat Clever Elsie and the girl both weeping together",6
"Then said the boy: ""What a clever Elsie we have!"" and sat down by her, and likewise began to howl loudly",6
"Then said the mother likewise: ""What a clever Elsie we have!"" and sat down and wept with them",6
"But when he got into the cellar, and they were all sitting together crying, and he heard the reason, and that Elsie""s child was the cause, and the Elsie might perhaps bring one into the world some day, and that he might be killed by the pick-axe, if he should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very time when it fell down, he cried: ""Oh, what a clever Elsie!"" and sat down, and likewise wept with them",6
"There was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and when she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that, was quite happy and thought: ""You certainly are a pretty girl!",4
"And when she came home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught of wine, and as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever she was cooking until she was satisfied, and said: ""The cook must know what the food is like.",4
"Then Gretel called out to her master: ""If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away from the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten the moment they are at their juiciest.",6
"She ran down, set a jug, said: ""God bless it for you, Gretel,"" and took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should not be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught",4
"Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them, and drove the spit merrily round",4
"She touched it with her finger, and said: ""Ah! how good fowls are",4
It certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right time!,6
"So she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she thought: ""The other must go down too, or else master will observe that something is missing.",4
"Then she said: ""Well, Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has been cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is eaten you will have some peace, why should God""s good gifts be spoilt?",4
"So she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the one chicken in great glee",4
"The guest heard the sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he could",3
"Gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried: ""You have invited a fine guest!",2
"""Why, Gretel",7
What do you mean by that?,7
"""That""s a nice trick!"" said her master, and lamented the fine chickens",6
"""If he had but left me one, so that something remained for me to eat.",6
"The guest, however, thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of his ears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take them both with him",3
"""That was ill done, Hans",2
"""That""s ill done, Hans, you should have put the knife in your pocket.",2
"""That was ill done, Hans, you should have carried the bacon on your head.",2
"""That was ill done, Hans, you should have led the calf, and put it in the stall.",2
"""That was ill done, Hans, you should have cast friendly eyes on her.",2
"The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say: ""That is the first thief,"" and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said to his comrade outside: ""The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he said I was the first.",3
"The second did not want to go in at all, but was forced",3
"This servant was equally alarmed, and he got out as fast as he could",3
"On this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the doctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment",3
"Then the fellow in the stove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out, crying: ""That man knows everything!",3
"""She is sitting in her room, Moaning in her gloom, Weeping her little eyes quite red, Because old Mr Fox is dead.",6
"So when Frederick and Catherine came down, there they found all their money safe and sound",4
"Last night, old Sanna carried so many buckets of water into the house that I asked her why she was doing that, and she said that if I would promise not to tell anyone, and she said that early tomorrow morning when father was out hunting, she would set the kettle full of water, throw you into it and boil you; but we will get up quickly, dress ourselves, and go away together.",3
"Then the children went home together, and were heartily delighted, and if they have not died, they are living still",4
"He had little to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the land, he could no longer procure even daily bread",6
"Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife: ""What is to become of us",6
"How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for ourselves?",6
"""But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same,"" said the man",6
"Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel: ""Now all is over with us.",6
"Gretel began to cry and said: ""How are we to get out of the forest now?",6
"The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone",4
"The man""s heart was heavy, and he thought: ""It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your children.",6
"And when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar",7
Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands,3
"Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down in them, and thought they were in heaven",4
"Scream as he might, it would not help him",3
"""Dear God, do help us,"" she cried",6
"""If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should at any rate have died together.",6
"Then Gretel gave her a push that drove her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt",7
"How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other",4
"Then they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round their father""s neck",4
"Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together in perfect happiness",4
"Hans was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up, squared his elbows, turned out his toes, cracked his whip, and rode merrily off, one minute whistling a merry tune, and another singing",4
"""No care and no sorrow, A fig for the morrow",4
"We""ll laugh and be merry, Sing neigh down derry!",4
"Away went the horse full gallop; and before Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his back by the road-side",7
"""Well,"" said the shepherd, ""if you are so fond of her, I will change my cow for your horse; I like to do good to my neighbours, even though I lose by it myself.",4
"""What a noble heart that good man has!"" thought he",4
"Hans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and then drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky one",4
"""If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly shall always be able to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese with it; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what can I wish for more?",4
"While he was trying his luck in milking, and managing the matter very clumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at last gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he lay a long while senseless",7
"""Heaven reward you for your kindness and self-denial!"" said Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the wheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to its leg",4
"So on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met with some misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all",4
"The countryman stopped to ask what was o""clock; this led to further chat; and Hans told him all his luck, how he had so many good bargains, and how all the world went gay and smiling with him",4
"Then he took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path; while Hans went on the way homewards free from care",4
"""After all,"" thought he, ""that chap is pretty well taken in",4
How happy my mother will be,4
"Talk of a pig, indeed",4
Give me a fine fat goose.,4
"""O""er hill and o""er dale So happy I roam, Work light and live well, All the world is my home; Then who so blythe, so merry as I?",4
"Hans stood looking on for a while, and at last said, ""You must be well off, master grinder! you seem so happy at your work.",4
"""Yes,"" said the other, ""mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts his hand into his pocket without finding money in it--but where did you get that beautiful goose?",4
"""How can you ask?"" said Hans; ""I should be the happiest man in the world, if I could have money whenever I put my hand in my pocket: what could I want more? there""s the goose.",4
"Hans took the stone, and went his way with a light heart: his eyes sparkled for joy, and he said to himself, ""Surely I must have been born in a lucky hour; everything I could want or wish for comes of itself",4
"People are so kind; they seem really to think I do them a favour in letting them make me rich, and giving me good bargains.",4
"So he laid the stone carefully by his side on the bank: but, as he stooped down to drink, he forgot it, pushed it a little, and down it rolled, plump into the stream",7
"""How happy am I!"" cried he; ""nobody was ever so lucky as I.",4
"Then up he got with a light heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on till he reached his mother""s house, and told her how very easy the road to good luck was",4
"Then on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said: ""Scour the whole forest through, and do not give up until you have found all three.",3
"The king, however, would not give his consent, and said: ""It is not safe in there; I fear it would fare with you no better than with the others, and you would never come out again.",3
"The boy had become afraid; he called and cried after him: ""Oh, wild man, do not go away, or I shall be beaten!",3
"Then he could easily guess what had happened, and much grief reigned in the royal court",6
"""Nothing nothing,"" he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that the man might not see it",3
You can imagine how terrified the poor boy was,3
"The king gathered together his people, and did not know whether or not he could offer any opposition to the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a mighty army",3
"When the king returned to his palace, his daughter went to meet him, and wished him joy of his victory",4
"The maiden laughed, and said: ""He does not stand much on ceremony, but I have already seen by his golden hair that he was no gardener""s boy,"" and then she went and kissed him",4
"His father and mother came to the wedding, and were in great delight, for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear son again",4
"One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be alone; and Jorindel said, ""We must take care that we don""t go too near to the fairy""s castle.",3
"Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled",3
"He prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain",6
"Many a time did he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go, but all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda",6
"He ran or flew after her, touched the cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when they walked together in the wood",4
"But the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved, and how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or unwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that came to the door",2
"""Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!"" sighed she; ""would that I had married King Grisly-beard!",2
"""Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!"" said she; ""would that I had married King Grisly-beard!",2
"""Ah! wretch that I am!"" sighed she; ""why did I not marry King Grisly-beard?",2
"""That is no business of mine,"" said the fiddler: ""why should you wish for another husband",2
Am not I good enough for you?,2
"Then she began to cry, and knew not what to do",6
Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly which had brought her so low,6
"All on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king""s son in golden clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her by the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she trembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was making sport of her",3
Joy was in every face and every heart,4
The feast was grand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish that you and I had been of the party,4
"This grieved him very much, for Lily was his dearest child; and as he was journeying home, thinking what he should bring her, he came to a fine castle; and around the castle was a garden, in one half of which it seemed to be summer-time and in the other half winter",6
"""A lucky hit!"" said he, as he called to his servant, and told him to go to a beautiful bed of roses that was there, and bring him away one of the finest flowers",4
"Then the servant was greatly frightened, and said, ""It may perhaps be only a cat or a dog.",3
"And when Lily came to the castle, he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him",4
"The wedding-feast was held, and they lived happily together a long time",4
"Then she rejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more, and set out with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see her, for they had thought her dead long since",4
"But she told them how happy she was, and stayed till the feast was over, and then went back to the wood",4
"But he would not, and said that it would be a very hazardous thing; for if the least ray of the torch-light should fall upon him his enchantment would become still worse, for he should be changed into a dove, and be forced to wander about the world for seven long years",3
"This said, he flew out at the door, and poor Lily followed; and every now and then a white feather fell, and showed her the way she was to journey",6
"""Now,"" thought she to herself, ""no aid of man can be of use to me.",6
"Thus the unhappy traveller was again forsaken and forlorn; but she took heart and said, ""As far as the wind blows, and so long as the cock crows, I will journey on, till I find him once again.",6
"Then poor Lily was led away, and forced to give up the golden dress; and when she saw that there was no help for her, she went out into a meadow, and sat herself down and wept",6
"And she rose up and drove them before her, till the bride saw them from her window, and was so pleased that she came forth and asked her if she would sell the brood",4
"Then the prince took care to throw away the sleeping draught; and when Lily came and began again to tell him what woes had befallen her, and how faithful and true to him she had been, he knew his beloved wife""s voice, and sprang up, and said, ""You have awakened me as from a dream, for the strange princess had thrown a spell around me, so that I had altogether forgotten you; but Heaven hath sent you to me in a lucky hour.",4
"There they found their child, now grown up to be comely and fair; and after all their troubles they lived happily together to the end of their days",4
"Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child",4
"One day her mother said to her: ""Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good",6
"The wolf thought to himself: ""What a tender young creature! what a nice plump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman",4
"When he had made two snips, he saw the little Red-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying: ""Ah, how frightened I have been",3
Then all three were delighted,4
"But Red-Cap went joyously home, and no one ever did anything to harm her again",4
"She walked over the meadow, and presently she came upon a baker""s oven full of bread, and the loaves cried out to her, ""Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago.",3
"The next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an old woman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified, and turned to run away",3
"The old woman spoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter into her service",4
"So she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began to grow unhappy",6
"She could not at first tell why she felt sad, but she became conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew she was homesick, although she was a thousand times better off with Mother Holle than with her mother and sister",6
"After waiting awhile, she went to Mother Holle and said, ""I am so homesick, that I cannot stay with you any longer, for although I am so happy here, I must return to my own people.",6
"Then Mother Holle said, ""I am pleased that you should want to go back to your own people, and as you have served me so well and faithfully, I will take you home myself.",4
"Then she went in to her mother and sister, and as she was so richly covered with gold, they gave her a warm welcome",4
"""Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago,"" cried the loaves as before",3
"The first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted herself to please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should get in return",4
"The next day, however, she began to dawdle over her work, and the third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie in bed in the mornings and refused to get up",2
"So Mother Holle very soon got tired of her, and told her she might go",2
"The lazy girl was delighted at this, and thought to herself, ""The gold will soon be mine.",4
The dog liked this plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed,4
So from this time forward Sultan had all that he could wish for,4
"Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she thought: ""He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does""; and she said yes, and laid her hand in his",4
"The king""s son was beside himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower",6
"Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but roots and berries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of his dearest wife",6
"Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at length came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness",6
"He led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and contented",4
"At the birth of her first little child she was very glad, and forgot the dwarf, and what she had said",4
"""Can your name be RUMPELSTILTSKIN?"" said the lady slyly",4
"Then he made the best of his way off, while the nurse laughed and the baby crowed; and all the court jeered at him for having had so much trouble for nothing, and said, ""We wish you a very good morning, and a merry feast, Mr RUMPLESTILTSKIN!",4
"""She sits upstairs in her room, Bewailing her sorrowful doom, Bewailing her trouble so sore, For old Mr Fox is no more.",6
"Then the wedding was solemnized with young Mr Fox, and there was much rejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off, they are dancing still",4
"When she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy, and called to one of her servants, and said, ""Take Snowdrop away into the wide wood, that I may never see her any more.",2
"The first said, ""Who has been sitting on my stool?",2
"The second, ""Who has been eating off my plate?",2
"The third, ""Who has been picking my bread?",2
"The fourth, ""Who has been meddling with my spoon?",2
"The fifth, ""Who has been handling my fork?",2
"The sixth, ""Who has been cutting with my knife?",2
"The seventh, ""Who has been drinking my wine?",2
"Then the first looked round and said, ""Who has been lying on my bed?",2
"And the rest came running to him, and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his bed",2
"And they were very glad to see her, and took care not to wake her; and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs in turn, till the night was gone",4
"Then the queen was very much frightened; for she knew that the glass always spoke the truth, and was sure that the servant had betrayed her",3
"Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see that Snowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in quite another dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned comb",2
"Then she dressed herself up as a peasant""s wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs"" cottage, and knocked at the door; but Snowdrop put her head out of the window and said, ""I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not.",3
"""No,"" said Snowdrop, ""I dare not take it.",3
"So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven watched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they would bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just as it did while she was alive; so they said, ""We will never bury her in the cold ground.",6
"And the birds of the air came too, and bemoaned Snowdrop; and first of all came an owl, and then a raven, and at last a dove, and sat by her side",6
"Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and besought them to let him take her away; but they said, ""We will not part with her for all the gold in the world.",6
"""But,"" said Roland, ""I counsel you first to take away her magic wand, or we cannot escape if she pursues us.",3
"""That shall not help you,"" cried she, ""even if you have got a long way off, you shall still not escape me.",2
"The poor girl remained there a long time, but at length, as he did not return at all, she was sad, and changed herself into a flower, and thought: ""Someone will surely come this way, and trample me down.",6
"He could not conceive how this came to pass, for he never saw a human being in his house, and no one could have concealed himself in it",7
"When the faithful maiden heard of this, she grew so sad that she thought her heart would break, and she would not go thither, but the other girls came and took her",6
"But when she began her song, and it reached Roland""s ears, he sprang up and cried: ""I know the voice, that is the true bride, I will have no other!",7
"Then the faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart Roland, and grief came to an end and joy began",4
"""With all my heart,"" said Partlet, ""let us go and make a holiday of it together.",4
"While this was passing, a duck came quacking up and cried out, ""You thieving vagabonds, what business have you in my grounds",2
"I""ll give it you well for your insolence!"" and upon that she fell upon Chanticleer most lustily",2
"He now flew into a very great passion, and, suspecting the company who had come in the night before, he went to look after them, but they were all off; so he swore that he never again would take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no reckoning, and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks",2
"Then he was very angry, and went without his supper to bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow, the pin ran into his cheek: at this he became quite furious, and, jumping up, would have run out of the house; but when he came to the door, the millstone fell down on his head, and killed him on the spot",2
"Then she was in a great fright, and cried out to Chanticleer, ""Pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or I shall be choked.",3
"Then Chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the beasts came and wept with him over poor Partlet",6
"Then he sat down by the grave, and wept and mourned, till at last he died too; and so all were dead",6
"He sat for a while very sorrowfully, then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which was still half full",6
"""What my commands are?"" replied the soldier, quite astonished",7
"When it was ready and the soldier had taken possession of it, he summoned the little black manikin and said: ""I have served the king faithfully, but he has dismissed me, and left me to hunger, and now I want to take my revenge.",2
"The manikin said: ""That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very dangerous thing for you, for if it is discovered, you will fare ill.",3
"""Aha! are you there?"" cried the soldier, ""get to your work at once",2
"At last he could bear it no longer; so he took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood",6
"""Because,"" said the dog, ""I am very very hungry, and have nothing to eat.",6
"""I have had plenty of meat,"" answered he, ""but I should like to have a piece of bread to eat after it.",4
"And the wife struck; but she missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down dead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest",7
"His conscience was clear and his heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed, left all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep",4
"In the morning after he had said his prayers, he sat himself down to his work; when, to his great wonder, there stood the shoes all ready made, upon the table",7
The good man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening,7
"As soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs; and they sat themselves upon the shoemaker""s bench, took up all the work that was cut out, and began to ply with their little fingers, stitching and rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that the shoemaker was all wonder, and could not take his eyes off them",7
"""These little wights have made us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them a good turn if we can",4
"The thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening, when all the things were ready, they laid them on the table, instead of the work that they used to cut out, and then went and hid themselves, to watch what the little elves would do",4
"About midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the room, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they saw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed mightily delighted",4
"Then they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and danced and capered and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at last they danced out at the door, and away over the green",4
"The good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them from that time forward, as long as they lived",4
"""Did not you ask it for anything?"" said the wife, ""we live very wretchedly here, in this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the fish we want a snug little cottage.",2
"""Ah!"" said the fisherman, ""how happily we shall live now!",4
"""Ah!"" said the man, dolefully, ""my wife wants to live in a stone castle.",6
"""Well,"" said the man, ""now we will live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of our lives.",4
So the man went away quite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king,6
"So the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along, ""This will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will be tired at last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done.",3
"At this sight the fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he trembled so that his knees knocked together: but still he went down near to the shore, and said",3
"The fisherman was half asleep, but the thought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed",3
"""No,"" said she, ""I am very uneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without my leave",2
"Then the man went shivering with fear; and as he was going down to the shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks shook",3
"They were still not safe; for he was such a great beast that in his fall he overset the boat, and they had to swim in the open sea upon a few planks",3
"So the tailor took his needle, and with a few large stitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these, and sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked them together so quickly that the boat was soon ready, and they then reached the ship and got home safe",4
"When they had brought home the princess to her father, there was great rejoicing; and he said to the four brothers, ""One of you shall marry her, but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be.",4
"Then the king put in a word, and said, ""Each of you is right; and as all cannot have the young lady, the best way is for neither of you to have her: for the truth is, there is somebody she likes a great deal better",7
"And the king then gave to each half a kingdom, as he had said; and they lived very happily the rest of their days, and took good care of their father; and somebody took better care of the young lady, than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have her again",4
"At last he said: ""Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of",2
Have you the cheek to ask how I am getting on,2
How many arts do you understand?,2
"The poor horse was very melancholy, and wandered up and down in the wood, seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain",6
"""Ah!"" replied the horse, ""justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has forgotten all that I have done for him so many years, and because I can no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless I become stronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can I have of that? he knows I have none, or he would not talk so.",6
"""Here he is, master,"" said he, ""I have got the better of him"": and when the farmer saw his old servant, his heart relented, and he said",4
"As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could",4
"But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head of her bed",7
"They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince""s kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great many years",4
"""Ah!"" said the young man, ""that would be a great thing, but how can you contrive it?",4
"Then the fox came, and said, ""Pray kill me, and cut off my head and my feet.",7
"So he said, ""Yes,"" and forgot the fox""s counsel, and sat down on the side of the river; and while he suspected nothing, they came behind, and threw him down the bank, and took the princess, the horse, and the bird, and went home to the king their master, and said",7
"Then he went to the king, and told him all his brothers"" roguery; and they were seized and punished, and he had the princess given to him again; and after the king""s death he was heir to his kingdom",4
"The wedding was celebrated, and after the king""s death, Dummling inherited his kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife",4
"They loved each other dearly, but sorrowed much that they had no children",6
"""Ah,"" sighed the woman heavily, ""if I had but a child, as red as blood and as white as snow,"" and as she spoke the words, her heart grew light within her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and she returned to the house feeling glad and comforted",4
"Once again the wife stood under the juniper-tree, and it was so full of sweet scent that her heart leaped for joy, and she was so overcome with her happiness, that she fell on her knees",4
"Presently the fruit became round and firm, and she was glad and at peace; but when they were fully ripe she picked the berries and ate eagerly of them, and then she grew sad and ill",6
"A little while later she called her husband, and said to him, weeping",6
"""If I die, bury me under the juniper-tree.",6
"Her husband buried her under the juniper-tree, and wept bitterly for her",6
"By degrees, however, his sorrow grew less, and although at times he still grieved over his loss, he was able to go about as usual, and later on he married again",6
"""Mother,"" said the boy, ""how dreadful you look",3
"""Oh!"" she said, ""I have knocked off brother""s head,"" and then she wept and wept, and nothing would stop her",6
"But Marleen stood looking on, and wept and wept, and her tears fell into the pot, so that there was no need of salt",6
"The mother said nothing, but gave him a large dish of black pudding, and Marleen still wept without ceasing",6
"Little Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out of her bottom drawer, and in it she wrapped all the bones from under the table and carried them outside, and all the time she did nothing but weep",6
"""Bird,"" he said, ""what a beautiful song that is you sing",4
"""How lighthearted I feel,"" said the father, ""so pleased and cheerful.",4
"""I do feel so happy,"" said the father, ""and how beautifully the sun shines; I feel just as if I were going to see an old friend again.",4
"""Look, mother,"" said the man, ""at the beautiful bird that is singing so magnificently; and how warm and bright the sun is, and what a delicious scent of spice in the air!",4
"He went inside, and said, ""See, what a splendid bird that is; he has given me this beautiful gold chain, and looks so beautiful himself.",4
And she now felt quite happy and lighthearted; she put on the shoes and danced and jumped about in them,4
"""I was so miserable,"" she said, ""when I came out, but that has all passed away; that is indeed a splendid bird, and he has given me a pair of red shoes.",4
"The father and little Marleen heard the sound and ran out, but they only saw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot, and when these had passed, there stood the little brother, and he took the father and little Marleen by the hand; then they all three rejoiced, and went inside together and sat down to their dinners and ate",4
"But as he drew near home, his little boy was so glad to see him that he crept behind him, and laid fast hold of his legs, and looked up in his face and laughed",4
"Then the father started, trembling with fear and horror, and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do; but as no gold was come, he made himself easy by thinking that it was only a joke that the dwarf was playing him, and that, at any rate, when the money came, he should see the bearer, and would not take it in",3
"At the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about his son, went into trade again, and became a richer merchant than before",4
"Meantime little Heinel grew up, and as the end of the twelve years drew near the merchant began to call to mind his bond, and became very sad and thoughtful; so that care and sorrow were written upon his face",6
"Then he took leave of his father, and set himself in the boat, but before it got far off a wave struck it, and it fell with one side low in the water, so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was lost, and went home very sorrowful, while the dwarf went his way, thinking that at any rate he had had his revenge",6
"Now the white snake was an enchanted princess; and she was very glad to see him, and said, ""Are you at last come to set me free",4
"And all came to pass as she had said; Heinel bore all, and spoke not a word; and the third night the princess came, and fell on his neck and kissed him",4
"Joy and gladness burst forth throughout the castle, the wedding was celebrated, and he was crowned king of the Golden Mountain",4
"They lived together very happily, and the queen had a son",4
"And thus eight years had passed over their heads, when the king thought of his father; and he began to long to see him once again",6
"At this the son was vexed; and forgetting his word, turned his ring, and wished for his queen and son",2
"In an instant they stood before him; but the queen wept, and said he had broken his word, and bad luck would follow",6
"He did all he could to soothe her, and she at last seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in truth, and was only thinking how she should punish him",2
"But the princes, peers, and great men mocked at him",2
"Then she opened the door for her husband, and said: ""Thank heaven, you are back again",3
"""Bless me!"" cried the miller, and went there and found the wine",7
"""Upon my word!"" cried the miller, and went thither, and found the roast meat",7
"""That would be a fine thing!"" cried the miller, and went there and found the salad",7
"""That would be a fine thing!"" cried the miller, and looked there, and found the cakes",7
"And now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller""s wife was frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with her",3
"As he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little dwarf met him, and asked him what made him so merry",4
"""Why, what should make me down-hearted?"" said he; ""I am sound in health and rich in purse, what should I care for",4
"Then the countryman rejoiced at his good luck, and said, ""I like many things better than money: first, I will have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly, a fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and thirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask.",4
"Our honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before, he was now ten times more so",4
"""Oh, what a pretty bird!"" said the miser; ""I would give a great deal of money to have such a one.",4
"So he took the purse, put up his fiddle, and travelled on very pleased with his bargain",4
"Meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous plight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve his late companion some trick",2
"At last he went to the judge, and complained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him into the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his back and a fiddle hung round his neck",2
"""No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you."" said the countryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the matter short by ordering him off to the gallows",2
"Then the miser said, ""Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity""s sake.",3
"Then he called to the miser, and said, ""Tell us now, you vagabond, where you got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only,"" ""I stole it,"" said the miser in the presence of all the people; ""I acknowledge that I stole it, and that you earned it fairly.",2
"But the sausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird flew out to meet him",3
"He picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he had seen and heard",6
"They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the best of things and to remain with one another",6
And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of tears,6
"The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently began to cry",6
"Then she went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings, and when the time was come she gave birth to a son, and the king was filled with gladness",4
"Then he carried the child away to a secret place, where a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to the king and accused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by the wild beasts",2
"When the king saw the blood on her apron, he believed this, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built, in which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had his wife put into it, and walled up",2
"The cook, however, thought to himself: ""If the child has the power of wishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble.",3
"The two played together, and loved each other with all their hearts, and the old cook went out hunting like a nobleman",4
"The thought occurred to him, however, that the king""s son might some day wish to be with his father, and thus bring him into great peril",3
"So he went out and took the maiden aside, and said: ""Tonight when the boy is asleep, go to his bed and plunge this knife into his heart, and bring me his heart and tongue, and if you do not do it, you shall lose your life.",2
"The cook once more said: ""If you do not do it, it shall cost you your own life.",2
"Now the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire household should eat with him next day, and made a great feast",4
"Whilst he was sitting there, he thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one of the king""s principal servants would begin to speak of her, and would ask how it was faring with the queen in the tower, and if she were alive still, or had perished",6
"When the king saw him he fell into a passion, and ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon",2
"The son said: ""Most gracious father, I will show her to you in the form of a beautiful flower,"" and he thrust his hand into his pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table, and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it",4
"She lived three days more, and then died happily, and when she was buried, the two white doves which had brought her food to the tower, and were angels of heaven, followed her body and seated themselves on her grave",4
"The aged king ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces, but grief consumed the king""s own heart, and he soon died",6
"Then their brother, who was a little insignificant dwarf, went out to seek for his brothers: but when he had found them they only laughed at him, to think that he, who was so young and simple, should try to travel through the world, when they, who were so much wiser, had been unable to get on",2
"At last came the little dwarf""s turn; and he looked in the moss; but it was so hard to find the pearls, and the job was so tiresome!--so he sat down upon a stone and cried",6
"She was sadder than ever as she drove along, and said mournfully, ""I know he has fallen asleep, and will not be able to set me free.",6
"She found him sleeping heavily, and all her efforts to awaken him were of no avail",6
"When the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping, he was grieved at heart, and said, ""She has no doubt been here and driven away again, and it is now too late for me to save her.",6
"He found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than it really was, from the contrast of its height with that of an immense giant who stood in front of it",7
"He thought to himself, ""If the giant sees me going in, my life will not be worth much.",3
"However, after a while he summoned up courage and went forward",3
"""I would rather you let that alone,"" said the man, ""for I do not willingly give myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food I have enough to satisfy your hunger.",3
"The giant was pleased with the good cheer, and ate and drank to his heart""s content",4
"Then he fetched other older maps, and they went on looking for the castle until at last they found it, but it was many thousand miles away",6
"""How shall I be able to get there?"" asked the man",6
"When he saw that it was impossible to reach her, he was greatly grieved, and said to himself, ""I will remain here and wait for her,"" so he built himself a little hut, and there he sat and watched for a whole year, and every day he saw the king""s daughter driving round her castle, but still was unable to get nearer to her",6
"When therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him, and cried aloud for joy",4
"Then he dismounted and took her in his arms; and she kissed him, and said, ""Now you have indeed set me free, and tomorrow we will celebrate our marriage.",4
"There was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter, and as she was grown up, he was anxious that she should be well married and provided for",3
But the girl did not care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband,6
"When Sunday came, and it was time for the girl to start, a feeling of dread came over her which she could not explain, and that she might be able to find her path again, she filled her pockets with peas and lentils to sprinkle on the ground as she went along",3
"""Ah, you poor child,"" answered the old woman, ""what a place for you to come to",6
"If I did not take pity on you and save you, you would be lost.",6
"The poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind the cask, for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her by the robbers",3
"She was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers, who were lying close together, and every moment she was filled with renewed dread lest she should awaken them",3
"The bridegroom, who during this recital had grown deadly pale, up and tried to escape, but the guests seized him and held him fast",3
"The huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, ""If all this does happen, it will be a fine thing for me.",4
"""Alas! dear sir,"" said she, ""yonder lies the granite rock where all the costly diamonds grow, and I want so much to go there, that whenever I think of it I cannot help being sorrowful, for who can reach it? only the birds and the flies--man cannot.",6
The diamonds glittered so on all sides that they were delighted with the sight and picked up the finest,4
"When he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him, and left him alone on the wild rock, he said, ""Alas! what roguery there is in the world!"" and there he sat in great grief and fear, not knowing what to do",6
"However, he still felt very hungry, and the salad tasted very nice; so he ate on till he came to another kind of salad, and scarcely had he tasted it when he felt another change come over him, and soon saw that he was lucky enough to have found his old shape again",4
"And the beautiful young lady fell upon her knees before him, and said, ""O dearest huntsman! forgive me all the ill I have done you; my mother forced me to it, it was against my will, for I always loved you very much",6
"So they were married, and lived together very happily till they died",4
"Each wanted to be first at drawing the water, and so they were in such a hurry that all let their pitchers fall into the well, and they stood very foolishly looking at one another, and did not know what to do, for none dared go home",3
"Then she was much grieved, and went to her father and mother, and asked if she had any brothers, and what had become of them",6
"So they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but said it was the will of Heaven, and that her birth was only the innocent cause of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day, and thought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back; and she had neither rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole away, and set out into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever they might be, and free them, whatever it might cost her",6
"When the little girl heard this (for she stood behind the door all the time and listened), she ran forward, and in an instant all the ravens took their right form again; and all hugged and kissed each other, and went merrily home",4
"At length she became uneasy, and wakened the boy, and asked: ""Do you know where my husband is",3
"She carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the boy""s father, ""Your boy,"" cried she, ""has been the cause of a great misfortune",2
He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke his leg,2
Take the good-for-nothing fellow out of our house.,2
"""What wicked tricks are these?"" said he",2
Go out of my sight,2
I will see you no more.,2
"If you are cold, come and take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves.",2
Ah! now I know what it is to shudder!,4
"""The old woman has destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at once, and took their lives",6
"But when she had reached the middle, and heard the water rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still, and ventured no farther",3
"The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the tailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam",4
"""Lord have mercy on us!"" cried the father; ""is that all you have learnt",2
"Then the father fell into a rage and said: ""Oh, you lost man, you have spent the precious time and learnt nothing; are you not ashamed to appear before my eyes",2
"The youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress where he begged for a night""s lodging",6
"He listened to them, and when he became aware of what they were saying, he grew very thoughtful and sad",6
"Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my ease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress laid hold of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky enough to get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon.",6
"""Oh,"" said the ass, ""by all means go with us to the great city; you are a good night singer, and may make your fortune as a musician.",4
"The cat was pleased with the thought, and joined the party",4
"""With all my heart,"" said the cock: so they all four went on jollily together",4
"""Why, I see a table spread with all kinds of good things, and robbers sitting round it making merry.",7
"The coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what the robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not expected to eat again for a month",4
"After this the robbers never dared to go back to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters that they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at this very day",4
"But whilst they were getting all ready, they heard the trampling of a horse at a distance, which so frightened them that they pushed their prisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung him up by a cord to the tree, where they left him dangling, and ran away",3
"As soon as the man in the sack saw him passing under the tree, he cried out, ""Good morning! good morning to thee, my friend!",7
"When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed heartily; and the eldest said, ""This fellow too might have done a wiser thing than lose his life in this way!",4
"Then they rose up and opened their drawers and boxes, and took out all their fine clothes, and dressed themselves at the glass, and skipped about as if they were eager to begin dancing",4
"But the youngest said, ""I don""t know how it is, while you are so happy I feel very uneasy; I am sure some mischance will befall us.",3
"The soldier saw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put on the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them; but in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest princess, and she cried out to her sisters, ""All is not right; someone took hold of my gown.",3
"Then the youngest daughter said again, ""I am sure all is not right--did not you hear that noise",3
"And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there was a loud noise, which made the youngest sister tremble with fear; but the eldest still said, it was only the princes, who were crying for joy",3
"At this, too, the youngest sister was terribly frightened, but the eldest always silenced her",3
"The son was in such trouble that he did not think what he was doing, and said: ""Yes, dear father, your will shall be done,"" and thereupon the king shut his eyes, and died",6
"His first betrothed heard of this, and fretted so much about his faithfulness that she nearly died",6
"The king thought something had happened to his dear huntsman, ran up to him, wanted to help him, and drew his glove off",3
"Then his heart was so touched that he kissed her, and when she opened her eyes he said: ""You are mine, and I am yours, and no one in the world can alter that.",4
"The giant took the trunk on his shoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who could not look round, had to carry away the whole tree, and the little tailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and whistled the song: ""Three tailors rode forth from the gate,"" as if carrying the tree were child""s play",4
"But he did not venture to give him his dismissal, for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his people dead, and place himself on the royal throne",3
"""I""ll put a screw into that business,"" said the little tailor",2
"His sons were very much grieved at their father""s sickness; and as they were walking together very mournfully in the garden of the palace, a little old man met them and asked what was the matter",6
"They told him that their father was very ill, and that they were afraid nothing could save him",6
"""Mind your own affairs, busybody!"" said the prince scornfully, and rode on",2
"Then he sprang from the couch dreadfully frightened, ran to the well, filled a cup that was standing by him full of water, and hastened to get away in time",3
"The old king was still very angry with his youngest son, and thought that he really meant to have taken away his life; so he called his court together, and asked what should be done, and all agreed that he ought to be put to death",2
"""He is still alive,"" said the huntsman; ""and I am glad that I had pity on him, but let him go in peace, and brought home his royal coat.",4
"At this the king was overwhelmed with joy, and made it known thoughout all his kingdom, that if his son would come back to his court he would forgive him",4
"So he journeyed on, thinking of her all the way, and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the road was made of, but went with his horse straight over it; and as he came to the gate it flew open, and the princess welcomed him with joy, and said he was her deliverer, and should now be her husband and lord of the kingdom",4
"And now the old king gathered together his court, and asked all his kingdom to come and celebrate the wedding of his son and the princess",4
"And young and old, noble and squire, gentle and simple, came at once on the summons; and among the rest came the friendly dwarf, with the sugarloaf hat, and a new scarlet cloak",4
"And all the good people they danced and they sung, And feasted and frolick""d I can""t tell how long",4
"But when he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it, so he cut of a little bit and put it into his mouth",4
"The king ordered the man to be brought before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he could before the morrow point out the thief, he himself should be looked upon as guilty and executed",2
In his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought how to help himself out of his trouble,3
"They were telling one another of all the places where they had been waddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found; and one said in a pitiful tone: ""Something lies heavy on my stomach; as I was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queen""s window.",6
"They leapt with delight, put out their heads, and cried to him: ""We will remember you and repay you for saving us!",4
"Then they came hopping up to it, satisfied their hunger, and cried: ""We will remember you--one good turn deserves another!",4
"All the people grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away, leaving him alone by the sea",6
Full of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant him the promised reward,4
"But when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in birth, she scorned him, and required him first to perform another task",2
"The youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might be possible to perform this task, but he could think of nothing, and there he sat sorrowfully awaiting the break of day, when he should be led to death",6
"The youth, full of joy, set out homewards, and took the Golden Apple to the king""s beautiful daughter, who had now no more excuses left to make",4
"They cut the Apple of Life in two and ate it together; and then her heart became full of love for him, and they lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age",4
"The willow-wren with his army also came flying through the air with such a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one was uneasy and afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each other",3
"There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and loved them with all the love of a mother for her children",4
"Then the old one bleated, and went on her way with an easy mind",4
"The miller thought to himself: ""The wolf wants to deceive someone,"" and refused; but the wolf said: ""If you will not do it, I will devour you.",2
"Then the miller was afraid, and made his paws white for him",3
They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves,3
Ah! what a sight she saw there,7
Then you may imagine how she wept over her poor children,6
"At length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with her",6
"""Ah, heavens,"" she said, ""is it possible that my poor children whom he has swallowed down for his supper, can be still alive?",7
What rejoicing there was,4
"They embraced their dear mother, and jumped like a tailor at his wedding",4
"When the seven kids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud: ""The wolf is dead",4
"The wolf is dead!"" and danced for joy round about the well with their mother",4
"""How lonely it is, wife,"" said he, as he puffed out a long curl of smoke, ""for you and me to sit here by ourselves, without any children to play about and amuse us while other people seem so happy and merry with their children!",6
"""What you say is very true,"" said the wife, sighing, and turning round her wheel; ""how happy should I be if I had but one child",6
"So they said, ""Well, we cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and, little as he is, we will love him dearly.",4
"When the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart, and put Tom into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the beast how to go, crying out, ""Go on!"" and ""Stop!"" as he wanted: and thus the horse went on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the wood",7
"""Good night, my masters!"" said he, ""I""m off! mind and look sharp after me the next time.",4
"He still, however, slept on, and did not awake till he found himself in the mouth of the cow; for the cook had put the hay into the cow""s rick, and the cow had taken Tom up in a mouthful of it",7
"But he soon found out where he really was; and was forced to have all his wits about him, that he might not get between the cow""s teeth, and so be crushed to death",3
"""It is rather dark,"" said he; ""they forgot to build windows in this room to let the sun in; a candle would be no bad thing.",3
"A hungry wolf sprang out, and swallowed up the whole stomach, with Tom in it, at one gulp, and ran away",7
"And his father said, ""Heaven be praised! we have found our dear child again""; and he told his wife not to use the scythe for fear she should hurt him",4
"Then he aimed a great blow, and struck the wolf on the head, and killed him on the spot! and when he was dead they cut open his body, and set Tommy free",4
"""Ah!"" said the father, ""what fears we have had for you!",4
"""Yes, father,"" answered he; ""I have travelled all over the world, I think, in one way or other, since we parted; and now I am very glad to come home and get fresh air again.",4
"""Well,"" said they, ""you are come back, and we will not sell you again for all the riches in the world.",4
"Then they hugged and kissed their dear little son, and gave him plenty to eat and drink, for he was very hungry; and then they fetched new clothes for him, for his old ones had been quite spoiled on his journey",4
One day there was an elf walking on a forest path.,
"As he was walking, he came upon a
person named Mat.",
"Mat asked the elf, "" Where are you going?""",
"The elf said, ""I'm going down the path.""",
""" Can I come along?""",
"""Sure,"" said the elf, "" but beware, the bush is really wild, the grass is pretty high and the
water is very deep!",3
"Do you still want to go?""",
"Mat said, ""Well, if you put that way, I guess I'll change my mind.",6
So the elf left.,
"Mat really
didn't trust the elf so he decided to follow him.",
"In a very short time Mat saw that the elf had
tried to trick him.",2
"The grass was not high and there weren't any wild bushes and the water
was not deep at all.",
The elf just didn't wanted Mat around at all.,
"Mat jumped out from behind the bushes and said to the elf, ""You tried to trick me. Why
didn't you let me come with you?""",2
The elf felt badly and he told Mat that he was sorry.,6
"He asked Mat to come with him and the
two kept on walking.",
They walked until they came to another guy named Brian.,
"Brian asked
them where they were going.",
"The elf said, ""We are going for a walk in the forest.",
"Would you like to come?""",
"Brian said, "" No thank you.",
"I hear from Mat's friends that the bushes were wild and the
grass is pretty high and the water is pretty deep.""",3
"The elf replied, ""I just told him those things.",
"But really they are not as bad as I said they
are.",
You can ask Mat yourself.,
"This is Mat.""",
"But Brian said, "" I will pass on that.""",
"The elf said, ""OK with me.",
We'll go ourselves.,
"Don't say we didn't ask you come along for
the walk.""",
Mat and the elf went off into the forest.,
"They were hungry so the began to search for some
food to eat.",
"As they were looking, they ran into Larry.",
"He asked them, ""Where are you
going?""",
"""We're going to the forest for a walk.",
"Would you like to come with us?""",
"asked the
elf.",
"Larry said, ""Yes, I would like to come with you.",4
"How far are you going?""",
"""Oh we are going as far as we can go.""",
"""I would like to come with you.",4
"I'm going by myself and there is not going be anyone
around to talk to.""",
"The elf said, "" Together we can explore many wonderful things.",4
"We three can enjoy our
walk together.",4
"It's much better to do things with friends than it is to do things alone.""",4
To this they all agreed and so off they went together.,
Once upon a Christmas holiday there was a poor family.,6
"There was a mother and father and
two little ones.",
"The family was so poor that they had no place to live except in an old car
out in the back streets.",6
"People that knew of them didn't understand their situation because
they didn't try to understand.",
"The town people would call them names and point fingers at
them.",
"One day the two little ones went up to their mother and father and asked, "" Why do we live
in a car and not in a house?",6
"Why aren't we in school?""",6
"They had tears rolling down their
cheeks.",6
"Both parents sat them down, "" Dear children, we do not have these things because we don't
have jobs.",
We have tried to hang on to our jobs.,
"It seems the people we always help are
too worried.",
They worry about the way people look and not the work itself.,6
"We have little
money to buy new clothes.",
We've tried to ask people for help but we can't get it.,6
"That's why
we aren't able to have the things that others have.""",
"The children understood and didn't ever
ask again.Their parents sent them to the car to go to bed.",
"It was the next day and it was the mother's
turn to go out and see if anyone would hire her.",
There was no luck at all.,6
"So the mother and
father sat down and talked about what they could try to do about the problems and make
their children's dream come true.",
"That day a rich man, by the name of Joe, came into town.",
"Joe had so much money in his
pockets that he didn't know what to do with it all.",
"Joe was the kind of person that couldn't
have children.",
He wished that one day he could have children.,
"He thought about adopting
children some day.",
He wasn't quite sure what to do.,
Joe' had a heart of gold.,4
"He never
thought about himself; he was always thinking of others and what they need.",
As he was driving along this night he noticed a family of four.,
"They were picking through the
garbage for food; to keep warm they stood by a flaming garbage bin.",
"He noticed that they
were wearing rags.",
Their faces were dirty and their hair was messed really badly.,6
"Joe
walked by and thought some more about what he should do.",
The next day the mother and father went out to look for work.,
"It was coming close to
Christmas Eve and they wanted to try to find work once more before everything had closed.",
Door to door they went.,
"Every where they went they were booted out, rejected, and doors
slammed in their faces.",
Joe was to witness this and he felt really badly.,6
"He couldn't believe how selfish the people
who lived in town were.",2
Joe wanted to do something about it.,
"He thought for awhile, then
he realized this family had something that he wanted and that was a family.",
"Joe had
something that they wanted.",
This was a home.,
So Joe decided he would approach them.,
"""I have been watching you since I came into town.",
"I have seen you and your wife trying to make a living but when you have not been able to
find work, you can't make a living that way.",
I've been thinking for couple of days.,
"I have
something you want.",
This is a home.,
You have something that I want.,
This is a family.,
I want to invite you into my home for Christmas.,
"After Christmas if you want to be a part of
my family or should I say if I could be apart of your family, we can discuss it""",
"The family
said, ""Yes!""",4
After Christmas they all agreed that they should become a family.,4
"The children
began school.",4
The parents got a job and they lived 4 ever after.,4
"A long, long time ago, there was a rabbit that lived in a beautiful mountain.",4
"He was a 4
and clever rabbit.",4
His best friend was an old eagle.,
Also there on the mountain was a witch.,
The witch liked to eat children.,3
"She would always
go outside to search for her food.",
"One day as the rabbit played at the foot of the mountain, he saw a lady crying.",
"She cried so
that the rabbit felt pity on her.",6
The rabbit run to the lady.,
"""Mamma, what is the cause for your crying? """,6
"The lady couldn't stop crying, ""I went to the mill an hour ago.",
"When I got back my baby had
been stolen.",6
"I can't live without my baby.""",6
She continued crying.,6
"""Don't cry.""",
said the rabbit.,
"""My friends and I will try to find your baby.",
"Quickly follow me.""",
The rabbit was pretty sure that was the witch had taken the child.,
"He was afraid of the
witch had eaten the baby already.",3
He hoped they were not too late.The rabbit found the eagle quickly.,
"He told the story to him, He asked the eagle to help him
search.",
The eagle flew off.,
"Just a few minutes later, the eagle came back.",
"He had found the
baby.",
The witch had put him in a cage and hung it up in the tree in front of her house.,
"The
eagle also told the rabbit that the witch was getting ready to cook so they must hurry,
otherwise it would be late.",
The rabbit run to the witch house as the eagle followed in the air above.,
"They saw smoke
coming out from the witch's house They knew she was about to start cooking.",
"The rabbit
was so worried.",6
Suddenly he got an idea.,7
"He shouted, ""Witch!",
"Come here, I am going to
dance for you.""",4
The witch didn't want to see the rabbit dancing.,
"She said, ""Don't bother me, I am busy
cooking.",2
I have no time to watch you dancing.,2
"I want to eat my delicious food.""",4
The rabbit didn't give up.,
"He shouted again, ""Witch, I learned a new dance.",4
It is really good.,4
Come here.,
I will show you my new style dance.,
The time is still early.,
It is not late.,
"After
you finish watching my new style dance you will have lots of time to eat.",
"Come, Witch!""",
Finally the witch came out of the house.,
She watched the rabbit dance in her backyard.,
"She
laughed and she laughed; she forgot her lunch.",4
"After a half an hour, the witch suddenly remember her cooking and she said, ""Rabbit, stop
dancing.",2
"I must continue cooking.""",2
"And then back into her house, she went.",
She found that cage was no longer in the tree.,
"It was then that she became aware that the
rabbit had played a trick on her.",
"The baby had been taken away while she was watching the
rabbit's dancing.",
"She was really 2 and went back into the yard to find the rabbit, but
the rabbit had already gone.",2
"""Well, young trickster if I ever get hold of you I'll eat you.""",2
screamed the witch.,2
The eagle had taken the baby home while the rabbit was dancing.,
"The lady got her baby
and she was so very 4.",4
The witch was so very 2.,2
She tried to find the rabbit everywhere.,2
"But she could not find
him.",
"Until one day, she heard a drumming sound coming from the mountain.",7
"She ran
toward the sound.",
There she found the rabbit playing the drums.,
"She cackled loudly ""I found you at last.",2
"You will be sorry that you tricked me and stole my
lunch.",2
"Now you will be my lunch.""",2
"The rabbit pretended he didn't understand the witch said, ""What are you talking about?",
There are hundreds of rabbits on the mountain.,
"It must be another rabbit, I am a good
rabbit.""",4
"""Where?Where are the others?""the witch asked.",2
"The rabbit pointed to the big hive in the tree, and he told the witch, ""That is a new drum.",
Hit it hard.,
"When the rabbits hear the sound, they will come out.",
"""The witch believed the rabbit, and took the drumstick.",
"""Ready,"" the rabbit told her, "" I'll say
one, two, three and you begin to hit the drum.""",
"Then the rabbit ran far from the tree, and
loudly shouted, ""One, two, three, begin.""",
The witch hit the hive hard.,
You know what happened then?,
"A swarm of the wasps came
out.",
The witch couldn't hide anywhere.,
The wasps stung her.,
She screamed and run away.,2
She was never seen again.,4
This story begins a long time ago in the 1800's.,
"The story takes place in a beautiful
meadow.",4
There were high mountains surrounding the meadow.,
The people in the village often told tales that something evil lived in the meadow.,3
"The
people told tales of mysterious creatures.",3
"People from the near by village were frightened
by the tales.",3
Most would not go into the meadow.,
"There was only one person, Tannus was her name, who did not fear the stories.",
"Her
grandmother had told her about the strange creature that the people feared.",
"She had told
Tannus that this creature was special and only people who believed would see it.",
"Her
grandmother had called it a unicorn.",
Tannus remembered this story.,
"She would go to the
meadow and to look for the unicorn but she had never seen it.",
But she believed in it.,
One day Tannus was in meadow walking.,
Once again she was looking for the unicorn.,
"As
she walked she saw something from the corner of her eye.",7
"She turned to look and there it
was the unicorn.The unicorn had a beautiful white coat.",7
Its long mane was covered with gold dust.,
"His wings
looked like they were on fire.",7
"When Tannus saw it she remembered something more from
Grandmother's story.",
The unicorn's horn was said to have magic powers.,
"Grandmother had
said that if a person touches it she would receive three wishes.",
Tannus looked at the beautiful unicorn.,4
She slowly walked toward it.,
"She reached out her
hand and stroked its mane gently.",
The unicorn knelt and allowed Tannus to get on its back.,
Together they rode to the village.,
"When Tannus's mother saw them she called out, ""Get off that wild thing!""",3
"Tannus said, "" No!",4
It's not wild mother.,4
All that he needs is a friend.,4
He needs some love.,4
"Mom, come for a ride with me?""",4
"Mother said, ""No, Tannus!",3
We don't know anything about him.,3
"What does he eat?""",3
"""He eats grass.",
Grandmother told me about him when I was young.,
"She told me that I
could make a wish if I touch its horn and that the wish would come true.",
Tannus touched its horn and she made a wish.,
She wished for a castle.,
"Suddenly the castle
appeared.",7
It had solid gold trim.,
The ballroom floor was made out of pearls.,
"The pillars were
solid gold.",
Tannus wished a second time.,
"This time she wished for more unicorns so that her unicorn
could be 4 for the rest of his life and then there were more unicorns walking and
playing in the meadow.",4
She made a third wish and she wished for a prince for herself and the prince appeared.,7
"The
prince was having so much fun with to the beautiful unicorns.",4
"He was so amazed and 4
that he made his wishes for Tannus' mom.",7
The prince wished for a king for Tannus' mom.,
Tannus' mother was so 4 that she could have all the things that she wanted in her life.,4
"Now they could live happily ever after, and they did.",4
Many moons ago there was a folk tale passed down from generation to generation.,
"The
story is about the Cho-Cho Man or the Boogie Man.",
"It all began with a young boy named
Dakota.",
Dakota's mother had asked him to gather some firewood for the evening fire.,
"The nights
were getting cooler.",3
"Instead of doing the chore right away, Dakota figured he had enough
sunlight left to do two things.",
"He would gather the firewood after he played with his friends
Morgan, Joey, and Bo.",
"Not long after, his mother began to wonder why Dakota never came with any firewood.",7
Night had fallen fast and it was too hard to see the firewood.,
Dakota realized what had happened.,
"He told his friends about his predicament and they said
that they would help their friend.",
"Soon after, the young boys were gathering wood in the
dark.",
Dakota's mother was worried that something had happened.,6
She went looking for Dakota.,
"Not long after, she heard the boys.",
She had mixed feelings.,6
"She was 4 to see Dakota
",4
but she was also mad that he hadn't listened to his mother.,2
"She wanted to teach Dakota and his friends a lesson so she sneaked into the bush very
quietly.",
Then she picked up a twig and threw it.,
The twig hit the ground making noise.,
"It
caught the boys' attention.",7
She threw another broken twig in the opposite direction.,
"The
boys jumped.",
"The mother had a hard time holding back her laughter and a muffled moan
sounded through her fingers.",4
The boys were definitely scared.,3
But Dakota was the brave one.,4
He ventured forward.,
"The
mother moaned again; she threw another twig.",
The boys were transfixed.,
"Once more the
mother moaned in a low and deep voice, ""Listen to your mother.""",
The boys dropped everything and ran.,
"The mother could not hold back her laughter and the
boys, hearing this, scurried home even faster.",4
"After the mother had picked up some firewood, she proceeded home, where she found
Dakota in tears.",
"Dakota exclaimed, ""Mother, Mother I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.""",6
His mother held him with love and she knew that he was truly sorry.,4
"From then on when
Dakota felt like not listening, the mother would mention, ""The boogie-man will scare you if
you misbehave.""",
Once upon a time there was a sailboat named Troy.,

journey tomorrow.",
Troy would need another sailboat to come with him.,
"He had to decide whom he wanted to
take.",
Troy thought about taking sailboat Sabin but Sabin was too small and weak.,6
"Then
Troy thought about sailboat Trinelle.",
"""No!",
"He said to himself, ""She is a girl.""",
"""Hey!I know who I can take, Shaleisha"".",7
"Once again he thought about his choice and again
he said, ""No, I can't take her.",
She can't carry anything that's heavy; she will probably sink.,6
I really don't know whom I can take.,
Boy-oh-Boy!'',
"he said to himself, ""Think, think, think!",
That's what I always do!,
"I'm going to give myself a headache"".",6
"Suddenly, his eyes grew bright.",7
He had an idea!,7
"""Jessica sailboat!",7
"I know she is a girl but
she's big and a little wiser than I am.",4
Wow!,7
"I'm going to have a wonderful time with her
tomorrow.",4
"Well, now that I know whom I'm taking, I'm going to bed.",
"I have a long
journey.",
"""Troy woke up early in the morning.",
His mother had made him breakfast.,
"""This is so
wonderful that you are going to take your cousin with you.",4
"But remember, you guys have to
be back at eight o'clock sharp!""",
"Troy nodded, ""Yes mother.""",4
Troy's father gave him the directions before they left.,
"""What are we going to pick up Dad?""",
said Troy.,
"Troy's dad said, ""You two are going to pick up some of your sister's dol l clothes at Lake
Moon Light, south of Meadow Land Park.""",
So the two sailboats started out.,
"They waved, ""See you guys this evening.""",4
"Father waved to them, "" You two have a good time sailing there.""",4
"As they were sailing south, they saw big mountains and birds flying above them.",

sailboat had idea, ""What if we go through a short cut so that way we could be back sooner

"What do you think Troy noodle?""",
"Troy said, ""That sounds good to me.""",4
"By the time they got to their uncle's place they were so tired, they needed some rest.",
"So
they decided to visit their cousins for a while.",
"Then Troy noticed the time and told Jessica Sailboat, ""It's time to go now.",
"We have to be
back at eight o'clock, remember?""",
They had no time to waste.,
"This time they couldn't use their sails if they were to make it
home on time.",
"They started their motors up and waved back to their cousins, ""We'll see you
two soon.""",
Together they chugged along and they arrived home on time.,

clothes and his father said, "" You have done a good job.",4

Once up on a time there was mischievous raccoon named John.,
"He lived with a man name
Jim.",
John lived with Jim in a big house in the country.,
One day Jim had to go to the city for some business.,
"He put on his tall, tall hat.",
"Jim always
wore a tall, tall hat wherever he went.",
Jim knew that if he left John alone he would most likely get into things that he shouldn't.,
Jim didn't like to leave John alone and Jim knew he had to take John with him to the city.,
Jim and John got in Jim's car and drove to the city.,
"John was very excited because he hadn't
been to the big city before.",4
"The closer the car got to the city, the more exited John got.",4

front desk and he booked a room for two.",
Jim went to see how John was doing.,
"When Jim went to the car, the car was gone.",7

frightened.",3
He didn't know what to do.,6
A policeman came walking by just at that time.,
Jim was 4 to see him.,4
"He ran to the
policeman and said; ""My car is missing and John is in it.""",6
"The policeman said, ""I just saw a yellow car go rolling down the hill and there wasn't a
driver!""",
Jim was worried about what had happened to John and the car.,
"The policeman asked Jim
what had happened.",
Jim thought to himself.,
"Then he remembered that he had just had his brakes checked and
the man had said the brakes needed some work done very soon.",
Just then another policeman came running.,
"""I just saw a yellow car go down the hill.""",
"Both
the policemen and Jim went running down the hill.",

"Are we lucky,"" said Jim.",4
Jim was very 4 at first but he wasn't 4 very long.,4
He didn't see John anywhere.,6
He looked and looked but John wasn't anywhere to be found.,
"Then as Jim turned around, out of the corner of his eye he saw Joh n sitting in a tree.",

looked very scared.",3
Jim went over to the tree to help John.,

up to them and they began to bark at her.",

"Look the white and black and the orange and
black tigers are talking to you.""",
JD and Brenda were really excited.,4
"Then the tiger that look like Tigger began to talk to me, ""How come you say that I look like
Tigger?""asked the tiger.",2
"I was surprised that he was talking to me. """,7
"I - I think you look like Tigger because of the
way you walked and pounced off the stands.",
You remind me of the cartoon of Tigger.,
"You
pounce like he pounces in the forest.",
"Just then the two young tigers, the ones that were white and black, started talking to JD.",
"""It
must be nice to have freedom.",6
You are out in the world.,
"You are not stuck in a cage and
made to go from town to cities.""",
"JD looked at the tigers and said, ""Yes it is nice to be free.",
But still it must be nice to travel.,
"We don't travel around much to different cities or towns.""",
"The other orange and black tiger started to talk toward Brenda, ""Are you having fun looking
and talking to all the animals?""",
"Brenda replied, ""Yes, we are having fun.",4
"But we haven't seen all the animals yet.""",
"I heard my daughter's conversation and said, ""Come let's go see the bears and then the
elephants.""",
"""Yes.",
"Let's!""",
Brenda and JD said.,
We said goodbye to the tigers and we walked on to see the bears in their cages.,
"After, we went to the elephant's cages.",
We stopped and talked with the elephants.,
"We
asked the elephants how they liked being in the carnival and how old they were.",
"One
elephant said that she was about fifty years old and the other one said he was about
twenty-five years old.",
They said that they had been in the carnival for all of their lives.,
Our next stop was at the wolves.,
"We all like wolves so once again we stopped to talk with
them.",
The wolves talked to JD and Brenda.,
"They told us that they had only been in the
carnival for a few years.",
"They were surprised to see how many people like to see the
different animals.",7
But they were 6 that not many people stopped to talk.,
"""So, do you guys like us?""",
the wolves asked.,
"JD and Brenda said, ""Yes of course.",4
We like wolves very much.,4
"But we are sorry we can't
stay and talk longer.",
It's getting late and we still have to go to see the unicorns.,
"They are
the most beautiful animals of all.",4
Thank you for talking with us.,4
"Goodbye.""",4
Off we went to see the unicorns.,
"The unicorns had over heard the children saying that they
thought that unicorns were such beautiful animals.",4
"Before anyone could say anything, the
unicorns thanked the children.",4
"""You know many people do not believe in us and because of
that they can never see us.""",
"""Oh we believe in you and we find you to be the most fantastic animals.",4
"But it's so late now
and we have to go""JD, Brenda and I thanked the unicorns.",
"As we started to leave, the unicorns called out to
the other animals, ""Let's all say good bye.""",
"One unicorn said, ""I will count to three and we will say good bye.""",
"And he began to count, ""
One, two, three.""",
"And with a loud noise that almost sounded like thunder, all of the animals said good -bye
and good night.",
It had been a very special day for us.,4
"We had often talked to the animals but this was the
first time that the animals had talked to us.",
She closed her eyes and made a wish.,
She wished she could have five little stars.,
"She
wished they were hers to hold in her hands, to keep close to her heart and to care for and
to love forever.",4
"When she opened her eyes, something caught her eye.",7
"There were five twinkling stars all in
a row.",7
She knew these would be hers when the time was right.,
"They would be there
waiting.",
Time passed and when the time was right her first little star came to her.,
"She knew this star
was a boy so she named him Gabriel.",
He was so beautiful.,4
She was so 4.,4
"This was the
most wonderful feeling that she had ever known.",4
This little star was hers to keep.,
"She took
him in her hands and took care of him.",
She loved him with all of her heart.,4
"Gabriel gave her
so much joy in her life; she loved every minute of it.",4
Some time passed and the second little star came to her.,
"She also knew this star would be
a boy; she named him Javier.",
"And as with the first star, she took him in her hands and she
held him close to her heart.",
"She took care of him and loved him as much as she did her first
star.",4
Javier was such a beautiful star.,4
She couldn't believe her eyes.,7
The young woman was so thrilled to have two stars to love with all of her heart.,4
"Each time
she thought of them her eyes filled with tears of joy.",4
"Some time after, another little star came to her.",
"This one was also a boy so she named him
James.",
She took her new little star in her hands and she held him close to her heart.,
"She
cared for him and loved him as much as her first two little stars.",4
"He was so gorgeous she
couldn't believe this little star was also hers to keep.",4
Now she had three little stars to care for.,
She loved them all so very much.,4
"She watched
them grow and she admired them every day.",4
"She would take them out and show them to
the world.",
"As she enjoyed and took care of them, the years went by.",4
"She was in shock when the last two little stars that she had wished for came to her at the
same time.",7
She could hardly believe her good fortune.,7
"She had always wanted all boys but
when she had made her wish so long ago she had thought that this was too much to ask.",6
"The two new tiny stars were named Andrew and Adam Her other little stars: Gabriel, Javier
and James were so overwhelmed with joy that they wanted to help all the time.",4
The lady's heart was filled with joy.,4
She took her new little stars in her hands.,
"She held
them close to her heart and she cared for them.",4
"These two new stars were so tiny and
beautiful.",4
She had so much love in her.,4
She had enough to give all of them the love they needed.,4
They were all part of her life.,
They were hers to keep and love forever.,4
"As her five little stars grew, she would always tell them that she loved them all the same
and she always would.",4
"She promised that she would be there for them whenever they wouldneed her, just as they were there for her when she needed them.",
"Her wish had come true;
having five little stars was a joy.",4
Now she knows deep inside that when the time is right she would have to let go.,
"But even
at that time she will always hold them close to her heart and she'll be there when they need
a hug.",
"Five little stars that fell from the sky,
grow with all your might
let your bright lights shine,
Mom loves you all
so very, very much.",4
"Once upon the time, in a village, lived a mother and a daughter.",
They were every poor.,6
"In
this same village there also lived a very rich man.",
He was a chief in the village.,
"He was a
very bad chief.",2
"The people who lived in the village hated him, but they couldn't do anything
to him.",2
The poor people were forced to work in his fields.,6
He paid them so little.,6
"They had to
work all day long.",
The girl's mother had to be the chief's employee also.,
She too had to work all day long.,
When she got home she was exhausted.,
"Most time she fell asleep as soon as she arrived
home.",
"Before the rich man had come to the village the girl's mother would take the girl on her
knee and tell her stories.",
Now the mother never really had time to talk to her daughter.,
"The
daughter had not heard story from her mom for a long, long time.",
She missed these stories.,6
She had not talked to her mother for such a long time.,6
The girl felt pity for her mom.,6
She knew that her mother was tired.,6
"But secretly she really wanted to hear a story from
her.",
Also she had a lot of questions to ask.,
"The mother had made plans to send the girl
away to school to study and get an education.",
She wondered why.,7
"She wanted to know and
she asked her mother many times.",
"One day when her mom was not feeling well and could not go to work, she called her
daughter.",
"She sat beside her mother and the mother told a story to the daughter about two
birds.",
"The mom said, ""Once upon a time there were two brother birds that lived in a nest.",
They couldn't fly well yet.,6
One day their mom went to look for food for them.,
A storm came.,
The wind blew hard.,
"It blew so hard that the young birds were thrown from
the nest and they were separated.",6
One bird blew to the another country.,
"There a gentleman caught him and looked after him
very well.",
"He grew up to be well education, gentle and kind.",
He had a good life.,4
The other bird blew to the ground.,
There a bad man caught him and forced him to work.,
The second bird grew up to be like the mean man.,2
"He became a bad bird.""",2
"Now she understood her mom's story and she could see that her mother loved her enough
to send her away so that she might have a better life.",4
She promised her mom that when she grew up she would leave and get an education and be a good girl.,4
"She promised her that she would return and take her mother away to a
better place.",4
"Her mother hugged her and told the girl that she was proud of her and that she was 4
to hear her promise.",4
"When the girl grew up she did leave her mother and went away to
study.",
She kept her promises to her mother and they live happily ever after.,4
"A long time ago, in a big beautiful forest there lived many animals.",4
"The animals in the forest
were 4 and they lived a wonderful life.",4
"One reason that the animals were 4 was
because in the forest there also lived a little princess.",4
"The little princess had long curly,
blonde hair.",
Do you know what her name was?,
"It might surprise you but her name was
Marina!",7
"Yes, Marina, a beautiful name for a beautiful little princess.",4
Every morning she would go to the park near the river to play with her friends.,4
"Mrs. Rabbit,
Mr.Skunk and the very young deer were her best friends.",4
One day they were playing together.,
"They were having so much fun that they lost track of
the time.",4
The sun went down and it became dark.,3
"The little animals were afraid to go home
alone.",3
Princess Marina had an idea.,7
"She said, ""Why don't you all come to my Grandpa's home with
me.",
"Grandpa doesn't mind it when I bring my friends to his place.""",
When Marina and her friends arrived at her grandpa's house her invited them in.,
"He gave
them all the treats that they could eat.",
After they ate they all played games.,
"After a time Grandpa in a deep loud voice said, ""It's time for bed now.""",
"Grandpa gathered
all the friends around and told them a bedtime story.",
Before long everyone was fast asleep.,
In the morning it was safe for the animals to go home.,
"Everyday Marina and her friends still play but now they make sure that they go home before
it gets dark.",
Many years ago dinosaurs were the largest creatures on earth.,
"Some were very large and
others small.",
They also came in many different colors.,
"Behind the fiery mountains was a
valley in which the dinosaurs spent the day.",
One sunny day the dinosaurs were playing a game of soccer.,4
"A new dinosaur that the other
dinosaurs had not seen before came walking by.",
"He stopped and watched and then he
asked, "" Could I play too?""",
All of the other dinosaurs looked at him.,
"Together in one giant voice they said "" NO!""",2
The reason they had said no to him was because he looked different than the others.,
"He
had a long neck and he was green.",
"None of them had ever heard of or seen a long necked,
green dinosaur.",
"The new dinosaur was very 6 because everyone said no to him and they even called him
'Greeny'.",6
His feelings were hurt.,6
Slowly he sat down and 6ly watched the others play.Time went by and then suddenly they all stopped playing soccer and they all looked up.,7
"One
of the dinosaurs had kicked their only ball into a tree.",
"The ball was too high for them to
reach.",
"But it was not too high for the long necked, green dinosaur.",
"He walked over and said to the
other dinosaurs, ""If I can get your ball down will you let me play with you?""",
"The other
dinosaurs decided that it was a good idea.",4
"The long necked, green dinosaur reached up with
his long neck and he easily got the ball down.",
Once again they began playing again.,4
They had a great time playing soccer.,4
"The other
dinosaurs said they were sorry for not letting him play with them and calling him names.",6
They had all learned a lesson that day.,
"Even though others may look different we should
accept them.",
We all have something special about us.,4
"The lonely dinosaur now had many friends and they played in the valley for many more
years.",4
Once upon a time there was a little boy named Peter.,
He lived with his grandmother.,
"His
grandmother went blind when she got older.",
"From a young age, Peter had to look after his
grandmother.",
"He grew up to be a kind, gentle and patient person.",4
He worked very hard.,
In Peter's country lived a king who was powerful and kind.,
The king had a daughter.,
"His
daughter was very pretty.",
The king worried about his daughter.,6
"He thought about his
daughter every minute of every day.",
"The king wanted his daughter to be 4 and he
wanted her to marry a good husband.",4
"As time went by, the princess grew up.",
She became more beautiful with each passing day.,4
"Her father, the king, thought hard about his daughter's future.",
"The king wondered what he
would have to do.",7
One day he had an idea.,7
"He sent the news all over his kingdom and he sent the
announcement to other countries too.",
"The announcement read, "" There will be a special
archery tournament.",
The man who wins this special archery tournament will claim the prize.,
"This prize is to marry the king's daughter.""",
All the people were excited.,4
"When Peter heard the news, he wanted to go to the archery
tournament very much.",4
He was very good at archery.,4
"He was so excited about the
tournament that he couldn't drink and he couldn't eat.",4
"When he went to sleep, he dreamed
about it.",
"When he awoke, he thought about it.",
He was excited.,4
"At the same time he was 6, too, because he was so small and ugly.",6
"His grandmother
asked him why he sounded so 6.",
"All he did was sigh and answer, ""I'm okay;
grandmother.""",6
His grandmother knew that he was 6 and she asked him again and again.,
"Finally he explained to his grandmother that he had heard the news about the king's
tournament.",
He told her how he felt.,
"His grandmother said, ""You are good at that game.",
"Why don't you try it?""",
"""I know I'm good at archery, but maybe some of them are better them me.""",
"""Don't give up.""his grandmother said, ""You can do it""",
"Peter said to his grandmother, ""But if I win the game, I don't think princess would marry
me.""",6
"His grandmother told him; ""It doesn't matter if she marries you or not.",
"Just try to be as
good as you can at the games.""",4
He thought for awhile.,
"Suddenly Peter said ""You're right grandmother.",4
I will try it.,
"""Peter trained himself.",
Soon he was ready for the game.,
"On the day of the games he got
ready to leave for the castle early in the morning.",
"He wasn't 4 about leaving his
grandmother alone.",6
He was worried about her.,6
But his grandmother told him he had to go.,
"Before he left, his grandmother gave him a red rose.",
"""After you win, give this rose to the
princess.",
"But before you give this to her, close your eyes and smell it's beauty.",
"Be strong
and be brave and win the game.""",4
He said good bye and left his grandmother and went to the castle.,
"When he arrived, Peter saw the big castle.",
There were many people there.,
"He was afraid to
go in.",
Peter thought and thought.,
"He almost went back to his grandmother and then he
heard his grandmother's words again.",
Peter knew he could not turn back.,
"He went across
the castle's bridge and through the castle's large gate.",
Inside he saw even more people.,
There were soldiers all around him.,
He was so afraid.,3
Everybody was excited about the game.,4
Peter stood in line waiting for the game to start.,
"He felt that everybody was looking at him
strangely because he wasn't a prince or a knight or anyone important.",
"The buzz of shopkeepers selling their wares and people talking and guessing who would win
filled the streets.",
What kind of person was going to marry the princess?,
"Would it be a knight
or perhaps a prince?",
There were many excellent archers at the tournament.,
Peter nervously waited for his turn.,
Finally the judge called his name.,
Peter stepped forward.,
He placed an arrow on his bow.,
"He
pulled the string, aimed and released the arrow.",
It flew through the air and it hit the target.,
The crowd gasped.,7
Peter looked and he could not believe it.,7
Peter had been lucky.,4
"He had
won the prize.",4
Nobody thought that Peter was going to win.,7
Slowly Peter walked to the front.,
He stood in front of the king and the princess.,
"With his
eyes looking down he offered the rose to the princess.",
"But before he gave her the rose, he
smelled its beauty, just like his grandmother had told him.",
"Magically, Peter turned into a strong, tall and handsome man.",7
"Everybody was surprised,
including the king and his daughter.",7
"Peter and the princess married and lived 4 ever
after.",4
"One gloomy, foggy day in the dark forest something strange happened.",7
"In the forest there
lived a purple, three-legged frog.",
"He could be found in the pond that was surrounded by
trees and bushes.",
The frog was very lonely.,6
At night he was very scared.,3
"He had no one to
play with.",6
This one day a red grasshopper came hopping along.,
"It saw the frog and it asked, ""Why do
you look so 6?""",
"""I have nobody to play with.""",6
"""My name is Jack and I will play with you.""said the grasshopper.",4
"""Oh goody!My name is Eric and I live in this wild pond.",4
"I can swim all day and night if I
wish to.",
I'm glad you are here because I have some games we can play.,4
"These games take
two to play.",
I can't play them by myself.,
"We can play games such as leap frog and follow the
leader.",
"Do you have a place to live, Jack?""""",
"Well not really but I was hoping you would let me stay here with you Eric.""",
""" Well of course you can stay with me,"" said Eric.",
"""It's dinnertime.",
"Come and I will show you
where you can sit.",
"After, we'll play follow the leader by jumping from lily pad to lily pad.",
Jack was curious.,4
"He asked Eric ""What happened to your other leg?'",
"Eric said, ""Nothing happened to my leg.",
"I was born this way.""",
"So the leg was not brought up
again.",
After dinner Eric and Jack played all night till dawn.,
"When the sun came up, Eric and Jack sat by the pond wondering what to do next.",7
"Eric
suggested, ""Let's go hopping around.",
"We'll play follow the leader next.""",
The next day another frog came along.,
"The new frog said, ""Hello, my name is Sabrina.""",
"The purple frog said, ""My name is Eric and this is my friend Jack, the grasshopper.",
"Then
they all went out to play in the bushes.",
"Before it got dark, they all went back to the pond.",
"Eric asked Jack and Sabrina to listen to
what he was going to tell them.",
"Eric and his friend, Jack, asked her if she wanted stay with
them!",
"""Of course!""",
she said.,
The next morning the three of them saw lizard creeping up to them.,
"They all said, ""Hello!""",
"The lizard said, ""My name is Tiffany.""",
"All three introduced themselves to Tiffany, the lizard.",
Eric and Sabrina began to raise a family.,
"Each day Eric and Sabrina went for a swim with
the youngsters.",
All of them had a good time in the pond together.,4
"Sabrina and Tiffany stayed close by the pond watching the children while Eric and Jack went
out to the bushes to see if there were any insects they could get for supper for everyone.",
"After they enjoyed their meal, they would play.",4
One day Jack and Tiffany decided to live somewhere else.,
"They all said goodbye to their
friends and they promised that they would meet again soon.",
Eric and Sabrina did their usual daily routine with the youngsters.,
"The family played
leapfrog, had dinner and swam all day together.",4
"During the early evening, they would tell
the youngsters stories.",
"Eric, Sabrina and their youngsters lived happily ever after.",4
