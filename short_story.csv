394,"""My name is Michael.",
395,"""Butch looked at Michael and told him ""Don't be afraid.""",4
396,"Butch started talking to Michael
about where he came from and the places he has been.",
397,"Michael felt at ease as Butch started
talking to him about his life.",
398,Weeks past by as Michael and Butch got to know each other.,
399,"Both Michael and Butch
started hanging out at Michael place, in the basement.",

after so many years of being alone.",4

403,Once upon a time there was an angel name Samantha.,
404,She was always getting into trouble.,6
405,Samantha would make up stories and she was always getting into a lot of hot water.,
406,"Some
of the other angels noticed this.",
407,They started talking about how they should deal with this.,
408,"One angel said, ""Maybe we could teach her a lesson.""",
409,They all agreed.,
410,"The next day they
called Sam into the cloud room.",
411,"The boss of all the angels asked Sam to go down to earth
and help someone in need.",
412,"Sam said, ""OK.""
""But there is one thing you must remember,"" the boss angel said, ""You will not have any
powers.""",
413,Sam did not think this was fair.,6
414,"The big boss gave Sam a very nasty look and he
ordered her ""Go!""",2
415,Down to earth she went.,
416,She had to find someone in need of help.,
417,"Samantha looked and
looked all over the place.On one street corner she spotted two kids and a small dog.",
418,"Sam came up to them and
asked how they were doing; they said they were fine.",
419,Sam asked if they needed any help.,
420,One child looked at her very strangely and said no.,
421,She moved on.,
422,Next she saw two animals wondering around.,
423,"""They look lost.""",6
424,She said to herself.,
425,"She went
up to them and they began to bark at her.",
426,Sam became very scared and upset.,3
427,"She did not
know what to do.",
428,She calmed herself down and started to talk to them.,
429,"When they heard
her voice they stopped barking at her.",
430,"The angel felt very 4 and so she helped the little
dogs find their way home.",4
431,"Samantha was thinking to herself, ""If I could help instead of being bad all the time then I
would feel good about what I have done.""",4
432,When the little angel got home the boss asked her if she had learned a lesson.,
433,"Sam told him
that she had.",
434,The big boss was very pleased.,4
435,"When Sam left the room, all the little angels asked her if she was all right.",
436,Sam said yes.,
437,Everyone was 4.,4

439,"One day, JD, Brenda and I were watching TV and we saw an ad on TV.",
440,"The carnival was in
town on August 8-14.",
441,"JD and Brenda said, ""Can we go this year, Mom?""",
442,"I smiled at them and said, "" Yes, this year we will go.""",4
443,The children and I saved our money.,
444,"When August came around we went to the carnival at
the Exhibition Grounds.",
445,We were excited.,4
446,"The children wanted to see all the animals at the
carnival.",
447,"They wanted to see the tigers with their two-colored coats, the elephants, the
bears, the wolves and the unicorns.",
448,We started to walk.,
449,"The first animals we saw were the orange and black tigers and the
white and black tigers.",
450,The big cats put on a performance for us.,
451,"I said to the children, ""The orange and black tiger looks like Tigger.",
452,"See the way he walked
across and pounced down off the stand.",
453,"It looked like he wanted to talk to his mom and the
other two tigers.",
454,They look like young tigers.,
455,"Look the white and black and the orange and
black tigers are talking to you.""",
456,JD and Brenda were really excited.,4
457,"Then the tiger that look like Tigger began to talk to me, ""How come you say that I look like
Tigger?""asked the tiger.",2
458,"I was surprised that he was talking to me. """,7
459,"I - I think you look like Tigger because of the
way you walked and pounced off the stands.",
460,You remind me of the cartoon of Tigger.,
461,"You
pounce like he pounces in the forest.",
462,"Just then the two young tigers, the ones that were white and black, started talking to JD.",
463,"""It
must be nice to have freedom.",6
464,You are out in the world.,
465,"You are not stuck in a cage and
made to go from town to cities.""",
466,"JD looked at the tigers and said, ""Yes it is nice to be free.",
467,But still it must be nice to travel.,
468,"We don't travel around much to different cities or towns.""",
469,"The other orange and black tiger started to talk toward Brenda, ""Are you having fun looking
and talking to all the animals?""",
470,"Brenda replied, ""Yes, we are having fun.",4
471,"But we haven't seen all the animals yet.""",
472,"I heard my daughter's conversation and said, ""Come let's go see the bears and then the
elephants.""",
473,"""Yes.",
474,"Let's!""",
475,Brenda and JD said.,
476,We said goodbye to the tigers and we walked on to see the bears in their cages.,
477,"After, we went to the elephant's cages.",
478,We stopped and talked with the elephants.,
479,"We
asked the elephants how they liked being in the carnival and how old they were.",
480,"One
elephant said that she was about fifty years old and the other one said he was about
twenty-five years old.",
481,They said that they had been in the carnival for all of their lives.,
482,Our next stop was at the wolves.,
483,"We all like wolves so once again we stopped to talk with
them.",
484,The wolves talked to JD and Brenda.,
485,"They told us that they had only been in the
carnival for a few years.",
486,"They were surprised to see how many people like to see the
different animals.",7
487,But they were 6 that not many people stopped to talk.,
488,"""So, do you guys like us?""",
489,the wolves asked.,
490,"JD and Brenda said, ""Yes of course.",4
491,We like wolves very much.,4
492,"But we are sorry we can't
stay and talk longer.",
493,It's getting late and we still have to go to see the unicorns.,
494,"They are
the most beautiful animals of all.",4
495,Thank you for talking with us.,4
496,"Goodbye.""",4
497,Off we went to see the unicorns.,
498,"The unicorns had over heard the children saying that they
thought that unicorns were such beautiful animals.",4
499,"Before anyone could say anything, the
unicorns thanked the children.",4
500,"""You know many people do not believe in us and because of
that they can never see us.""",
501,"""Oh we believe in you and we find you to be the most fantastic animals.",4
502,"But it's so late now
and we have to go""JD, Brenda and I thanked the unicorns.",
503,"As we started to leave, the unicorns called out to
the other animals, ""Let's all say good bye.""",
504,"One unicorn said, ""I will count to three and we will say good bye.""",
505,"And he began to count, ""
One, two, three.""",
506,"And with a loud noise that almost sounded like thunder, all of the animals said good -bye
and good night.",
507,It had been a very special day for us.,4
508,"We had often talked to the animals but this was the
first time that the animals had talked to us.",
509,She closed her eyes and made a wish.,
510,She wished she could have five little stars.,
511,"She
wished they were hers to hold in her hands, to keep close to her heart and to care for and
to love forever.",4
512,"When she opened her eyes, something caught her eye.",7
513,"There were five twinkling stars all in
a row.",7
514,She knew these would be hers when the time was right.,
515,"They would be there
waiting.",
516,Time passed and when the time was right her first little star came to her.,
517,"She knew this star
was a boy so she named him Gabriel.",
518,He was so beautiful.,4
519,She was so 4.,4
520,"This was the
most wonderful feeling that she had ever known.",4
521,This little star was hers to keep.,
522,"She took
him in her hands and took care of him.",
523,She loved him with all of her heart.,4
524,"Gabriel gave her
so much joy in her life; she loved every minute of it.",4
525,Some time passed and the second little star came to her.,
526,"She also knew this star would be
a boy; she named him Javier.",
527,"And as with the first star, she took him in her hands and she
held him close to her heart.",
528,"She took care of him and loved him as much as she did her first
star.",4
529,Javier was such a beautiful star.,4
530,She couldn't believe her eyes.,7
531,The young woman was so thrilled to have two stars to love with all of her heart.,4
532,"Each time
she thought of them her eyes filled with tears of joy.",4
533,"Some time after, another little star came to her.",
534,"This one was also a boy so she named him
James.",
535,She took her new little star in her hands and she held him close to her heart.,
536,"She
cared for him and loved him as much as her first two little stars.",4
537,"He was so gorgeous she
couldn't believe this little star was also hers to keep.",4
538,Now she had three little stars to care for.,
539,She loved them all so very much.,4
540,"She watched
them grow and she admired them every day.",4
541,"She would take them out and show them to
the world.",
542,"As she enjoyed and took care of them, the years went by.",4
543,"She was in shock when the last two little stars that she had wished for came to her at the
same time.",7
544,She could hardly believe her good fortune.,7
545,"She had always wanted all boys but
when she had made her wish so long ago she had thought that this was too much to ask.",6
546,"The two new tiny stars were named Andrew and Adam Her other little stars: Gabriel, Javier
and James were so overwhelmed with joy that they wanted to help all the time.",4
547,The lady's heart was filled with joy.,4
548,She took her new little stars in her hands.,
549,"She held
them close to her heart and she cared for them.",4
550,"These two new stars were so tiny and
beautiful.",4
551,She had so much love in her.,4
552,She had enough to give all of them the love they needed.,4
553,They were all part of her life.,
554,They were hers to keep and love forever.,4
555,"As her five little stars grew, she would always tell them that she loved them all the same
and she always would.",4
556,"She promised that she would be there for them whenever they wouldneed her, just as they were there for her when she needed them.",
557,"Her wish had come true;
having five little stars was a joy.",4
558,Now she knows deep inside that when the time is right she would have to let go.,
559,"But even
at that time she will always hold them close to her heart and she'll be there when they need
a hug.",
560,"Five little stars that fell from the sky,
grow with all your might
let your bright lights shine,
Mom loves you all

very bad chief.",2

to him.",2
567,The poor people were forced to work in his fields.,6
568,He paid them so little.,6
569,"They had to
work all day long.",
570,The girl's mother had to be the chief's employee also.,
571,She too had to work all day long.,
572,When she got home she was exhausted.,
573,"Most time she fell asleep as soon as she arrived
home.",
574,"Before the rich man had come to the village the girl's mother would take the girl on her
knee and tell her stories.",
575,Now the mother never really had time to talk to her daughter.,
576,"The
daughter had not heard story from her mom for a long, long time.",
577,She missed these stories.,6
578,She had not talked to her mother for such a long time.,6
579,The girl felt pity for her mom.,6
580,She knew that her mother was tired.,6
581,"But secretly she really wanted to hear a story from
her.",
582,Also she had a lot of questions to ask.,
583,"The mother had made plans to send the girl
away to school to study and get an education.",
584,She wondered why.,7
585,"She wanted to know and
she asked her mother many times.",
586,"One day when her mom was not feeling well and could not go to work, she called her
daughter.",
587,"She sat beside her mother and the mother told a story to the daughter about two
birds.",
588,"The mom said, ""Once upon a time there were two brother birds that lived in a nest.",
589,They couldn't fly well yet.,6
590,One day their mom went to look for food for them.,
591,A storm came.,
592,The wind blew hard.,
593,"It blew so hard that the young birds were thrown from
the nest and they were separated.",6
594,One bird blew to the another country.,
595,"There a gentleman caught him and looked after him
very well.",
596,"He grew up to be well education, gentle and kind.",
597,He had a good life.,4
598,The other bird blew to the ground.,
599,There a bad man caught him and forced him to work.,
600,The second bird grew up to be like the mean man.,2
601,"He became a bad bird.""",2
602,"Now she understood her mom's story and she could see that her mother loved her enough
to send her away so that she might have a better life.",4
603,She promised her mom that when she grew up she would leave and get an education and be a good girl.,4
604,"She promised her that she would return and take her mother away to a
better place.",4
605,"Her mother hugged her and told the girl that she was proud of her and that she was 4
to hear her promise.",4
606,"When the girl grew up she did leave her mother and went away to
study.",

608,"A long time ago, in a big beautiful forest there lived many animals.",4
609,"The animals in the forest
were 4 and they lived a wonderful life.",4
610,"One reason that the animals were 4 was
because in the forest there also lived a little princess.",4
611,"The little princess had long curly,
blonde hair.",
612,Do you know what her name was?,
613,"It might surprise you but her name was
Marina!",7
614,"Yes, Marina, a beautiful name for a beautiful little princess.",4
615,Every morning she would go to the park near the river to play with her friends.,4
616,"Mrs. Rabbit,
Mr.Skunk and the very young deer were her best friends.",4
617,One day they were playing together.,
618,"They were having so much fun that they lost track of
the time.",4
619,The sun went down and it became dark.,3
620,"The little animals were afraid to go home
alone.",3
621,Princess Marina had an idea.,7
622,"She said, ""Why don't you all come to my Grandpa's home with
me.",
623,"Grandpa doesn't mind it when I bring my friends to his place.""",
624,When Marina and her friends arrived at her grandpa's house her invited them in.,
625,"He gave
them all the treats that they could eat.",
626,After they ate they all played games.,
627,"After a time Grandpa in a deep loud voice said, ""It's time for bed now.""",
628,"Grandpa gathered
all the friends around and told them a bedtime story.",
629,Before long everyone was fast asleep.,
630,In the morning it was safe for the animals to go home.,
631,"Everyday Marina and her friends still play but now they make sure that they go home before
it gets dark.",
632,Many years ago dinosaurs were the largest creatures on earth.,
633,"Some were very large and
others small.",

635,"Behind the fiery mountains was a
valley in which the dinosaurs spent the day.",
636,One sunny day the dinosaurs were playing a game of soccer.,4
637,"A new dinosaur that the other
dinosaurs had not seen before came walking by.",
638,"He stopped and watched and then he
asked, "" Could I play too?""",
639,All of the other dinosaurs looked at him.,
640,"Together in one giant voice they said "" NO!""",2
641,The reason they had said no to him was because he looked different than the others.,
642,"He
had a long neck and he was green.",
643,"None of them had ever heard of or seen a long necked,
green dinosaur.",
644,"The new dinosaur was very 6 because everyone said no to him and they even called him
'Greeny'.",6
645,His feelings were hurt.,6
646,Slowly he sat down and 6ly watched the others play.Time went by and then suddenly they all stopped playing soccer and they all looked up.,7
647,"One
of the dinosaurs had kicked their only ball into a tree.",
648,"The ball was too high for them to
reach.",
649,"But it was not too high for the long necked, green dinosaur.",
650,"He walked over and said to the
other dinosaurs, ""If I can get your ball down will you let me play with you?""",
651,"The other
dinosaurs decided that it was a good idea.",4
652,"The long necked, green dinosaur reached up with
his long neck and he easily got the ball down.",
653,Once again they began playing again.,4
654,They had a great time playing soccer.,4
655,"The other
dinosaurs said they were sorry for not letting him play with them and calling him names.",6
656,They had all learned a lesson that day.,
657,"Even though others may look different we should
accept them.",
658,We all have something special about us.,4
659,"The lonely dinosaur now had many friends and they played in the valley for many more
years.",4
660,Once upon a time there was a little boy named Peter.,
661,He lived with his grandmother.,
662,"His
grandmother went blind when she got older.",

grandmother.",

665,He worked very hard.,
666,In Peter's country lived a king who was powerful and kind.,
667,The king had a daughter.,
668,"His
daughter was very pretty.",
669,The king worried about his daughter.,6
670,"He thought about his
daughter every minute of every day.",
671,"The king wanted his daughter to be 4 and he
wanted her to marry a good husband.",4
672,"As time went by, the princess grew up.",
673,She became more beautiful with each passing day.,4
674,"Her father, the king, thought hard about his daughter's future.",
675,"The king wondered what he
would have to do.",7
676,One day he had an idea.,7
677,"He sent the news all over his kingdom and he sent the
announcement to other countries too.",
678,"The announcement read, "" There will be a special
archery tournament.",
679,The man who wins this special archery tournament will claim the prize.,
680,"This prize is to marry the king's daughter.""",
681,All the people were excited.,4
682,"When Peter heard the news, he wanted to go to the archery
tournament very much.",4
683,He was very good at archery.,4
684,"He was so excited about the
tournament that he couldn't drink and he couldn't eat.",4
685,"When he went to sleep, he dreamed
about it.",
686,"When he awoke, he thought about it.",
687,He was excited.,4
688,"At the same time he was 6, too, because he was so small and ugly.",6
689,"His grandmother
asked him why he sounded so 6.",
690,"All he did was sigh and answer, ""I'm okay;
grandmother.""",6
691,His grandmother knew that he was 6 and she asked him again and again.,
692,"Finally he explained to his grandmother that he had heard the news about the king's
tournament.",
693,He told her how he felt.,
694,"His grandmother said, ""You are good at that game.",
695,"Why don't you try it?""",
696,"""I know I'm good at archery, but maybe some of them are better them me.""",
697,"""Don't give up.""his grandmother said, ""You can do it""",
698,"Peter said to his grandmother, ""But if I win the game, I don't think princess would marry
me.""",6
699,"His grandmother told him; ""It doesn't matter if she marries you or not.",
700,"Just try to be as
good as you can at the games.""",4
701,He thought for awhile.,
702,"Suddenly Peter said ""You're right grandmother.",4
703,I will try it.,
704,"""Peter trained himself.",
705,Soon he was ready for the game.,
706,"On the day of the games he got
ready to leave for the castle early in the morning.",
707,"He wasn't 4 about leaving his
grandmother alone.",6
708,He was worried about her.,6
709,But his grandmother told him he had to go.,
710,"Before he left, his grandmother gave him a red rose.",
711,"""After you win, give this rose to the
princess.",
712,"But before you give this to her, close your eyes and smell it's beauty.",
713,"Be strong
and be brave and win the game.""",4
714,He said good bye and left his grandmother and went to the castle.,
715,"When he arrived, Peter saw the big castle.",
716,There were many people there.,
717,"He was afraid to
go in.",
718,Peter thought and thought.,
719,"He almost went back to his grandmother and then he
heard his grandmother's words again.",
720,Peter knew he could not turn back.,
721,"He went across
the castle's bridge and through the castle's large gate.",
722,Inside he saw even more people.,
723,There were soldiers all around him.,
724,He was so afraid.,3
725,Everybody was excited about the game.,4
726,Peter stood in line waiting for the game to start.,
727,"He felt that everybody was looking at him
strangely because he wasn't a prince or a knight or anyone important.",
728,"The buzz of shopkeepers selling their wares and people talking and guessing who would win
filled the streets.",
729,What kind of person was going to marry the princess?,
730,"Would it be a knight
or perhaps a prince?",
731,There were many excellent archers at the tournament.,
732,Peter nervously waited for his turn.,
733,Finally the judge called his name.,
734,Peter stepped forward.,
735,He placed an arrow on his bow.,
736,"He
pulled the string, aimed and released the arrow.",
737,It flew through the air and it hit the target.,
738,The crowd gasped.,7
739,Peter looked and he could not believe it.,7
740,Peter had been lucky.,4
741,"He had
won the prize.",4
742,Nobody thought that Peter was going to win.,7
743,Slowly Peter walked to the front.,
744,He stood in front of the king and the princess.,
745,"With his
eyes looking down he offered the rose to the princess.",
746,"But before he gave her the rose, he
smelled its beauty, just like his grandmother had told him.",
747,"Magically, Peter turned into a strong, tall and handsome man.",7
748,"Everybody was surprised,
including the king and his daughter.",7

after.",4
750,"One gloomy, foggy day in the dark forest something strange happened.",7

trees and bushes.",

754,At night he was very scared.,3
755,"He had no one to
play with.",6
756,This one day a red grasshopper came hopping along.,
757,"It saw the frog and it asked, ""Why do
you look so 6?""",
758,"""I have nobody to play with.""",6
759,"""My name is Jack and I will play with you.""said the grasshopper.",4
760,"""Oh goody!My name is Eric and I live in this wild pond.",4

wish to.",
762,I'm glad you are here because I have some games we can play.,4
763,"These games take
two to play.",
764,I can't play them by myself.,
765,"We can play games such as leap frog and follow the
leader.",
766,"Do you have a place to live, Jack?""""",
767,"Well not really but I was hoping you would let me stay here with you Eric.""",
768,""" Well of course you can stay with me,"" said Eric.",
