# Text-To-Speech-with-emotion
Speech emotion recognition (SER) is an essential part of humanâ€“computer interaction.
An emotion-based text-to-speech model is the idea of synthesizing emotional audio via a text to-speech model. Emotion-based text-to-speech conversion system is proved as an improved
version of the traditional text-to-speech system. Emotions help us recognize the message
conveyed by the messenger in a more effective way.

Emotion based text to speech systems are beneficial for
educational purposes as they provide better knowledge to the person who struggles in decoding
the text and its contents, listening to stories from storytelling applications for young/budding
children. Emotion-based text to speech is going to be serviceable for visually impaired
individuals. It can also be used in robots for better communication.

# Proposed Model
The main objective of the proposed system
is to convert text-to-speech with emotions and to provide a better reading facility for all users. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the process that converts an
image of text into a machine-readable text format. Then a TTS synthesizer converts text into speech using real-time voice cloning and produces an audio
output to the user.

# Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- Bert Embeddings (ML model)

# Accuracy
The **accuracy** of trained model is **69.9%**, which is obtained using the ratio of total number of true positive and true
negative to the ratio of total number of observations.
